What bug have you fixed? What feature have you added? Why is it important?\r\nIf you are fixing a specific issue, include \"Fixes #ISSUE\" (replace with the issue number, remove the quotes) and the issue will be linked to this PR.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis Pull Request has been created to update the Active Model Basics Documentation. \r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nThis Pull Request adds the following two sections: \r\n- AttributeAssignment\r\n- Attributes\r\n\r\nIt updates the rest of the sections by trying to provide more information, be more clear, and include more examples. In some parts, it references the API where more information about the methods can be provided. \r\n\r\nI also addressed these as part of the changes:\r\n\r\n> There's the new ActiveModel::API module that was essentially a split from ActiveModel::Model, this difference can be better explained in the guides as it is in [the original PR](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/42042).\r\n\r\n> The Lint Tests section example shows ActiveModel::Model, it should probably be ActiveModel::API.\r\n\r\n> It's possible to expand validations with how to check for errors, and other common usage. As well as different types of callback examples.\r\n\r\n> Some examples use send, those can be updated to use public_send instead.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change. Changes that are unrelated should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [ ] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message. Ex: `[Fix #issue-number]`\r\n* [ ] Tests are added or updated if you fix a bug or add a feature.\r\n* [ ] CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature. Minor bug fixes and documentation changes should not be included.\r\n",

        "body": "I've ran into a race condition on attaching a file to a `has_many_attached` association. It tries to create 2 `ActiveStorage::Attachment` records, even though I attach only 1 file, so the other file is actually an `ActiveStorage::Blob` that was already created by another request.\r\n\r\nI've done a little research and found, that when the model gets saved the `attachment_changes['images'].send(:subchanges)` has 2 records:\r\n\r\n- `Changes::CreateOneOfMany` for the existing `ActiveStorage::Blob`\r\n- `Changes::CreateOneOfMany` for the new `ActionDispatch::Http::UploadedFile`\r\n\r\nI think, the problem is that when the subchanges get built, it loads `record.attachments` right before the blob is created in another request, and after the blob is created in another request, it loads all blobs for the subchanges. So in the end, it perceives the blob as a completely new attachment.\r\n\r\nMy specific case is super simple. I don't need to know anything about already existing attachments, so the only thing I need is to correctly save and upload the file. So I came up with the next workaround:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsubchange = ActiveStorage::Attached::Changes::CreateOneOfMany.new('images', @storage, params[:image])\r\nstorage.images_attachments << subchange.attachment\r\nsubchange.upload\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass Storage < ApplicationRecord\r\n  has_many_attached :images\r\nend\r\n\r\nclass Storage::ImagesController < ApplicationController\r\n  def create\r\n    @storage.attach(params[:image])\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nWhen we're doing multiple requests simultaneously, all the images should get saved successfully, in other words only 1 pair of `ActiveStorage::Attachment` and `ActiveStorage::Blob` is created.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n```\r\nActiveRecord::RecordNotUnique (PG::UniqueViolation: ERROR:  duplicate key value violates unique constraint \"index_active_storage_attachments_uniqueness\"\r\nDETAIL:  Key (record_type, record_id, name, blob_id)=(Storage, e51d4675-fe21-42cc-8633-3619ee4e9390, images, f306419f-bc1f-4aaf-b859-ba48e2055514) already exists.\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n**Rails version**: 7.1.1\r\n\r\n**Ruby version**: 3.2.2\r\n",

I believe this has been a change made in Ruby 3.0\r\n\r\nThis also fixes deprecation warnings being printed. The alternatives have been added more than a decade ago, I doubt versions from then would even run on Ruby 3.1 anymore (https://github.com/ruby-prof/ruby-prof/commit/4cdb1d74563b3dce4f5dad460f22d012b855949f)\r\n\r\nNow, if nobody has noticed this breakage, perhaps this is just dead code and should be removed instead? I was just curious what this one was about.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change. Changes that are unrelated should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message. Ex: `[Fix #issue-number]`\r\n* [ ] Tests are added or updated if you fix a bug or add a feature.\r\n* [ ] CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature. Minor bug fixes and documentation changes should not be included.\r\n",

Writing to the Rails cache shouldn't invalidate the main query cache.\r\n\r\ncc @byroot, @jeremy \r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nThis adds a `dirties` option to `ActiveRecord::Base.uncached` and `ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::ConnectionPool#uncached`.\r\n\r\nSetting `dirties` to `false`, means database writes to the connection pool will not mark any query caches as dirty.\r\n\r\nThe option defaults to `true` which retains the existing behaviour and clears query caches on all connection pools used by the current thread.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change.

This is fixed in the next patch release of `brianmario/mysql2` ([v0.5.6](https://github.com/brianmario/mysql2/releases/tag/0.5.6)).\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nThis Pull Request changes the specified version of the `mysql2` gem to be `>=0.5.6` to avoid installing a version that is incompatible with recent MySQL versions - namely `8.3.0`.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nFWIW I am not familiar enough with Rails and its reliance on this gem to properly diagnose any potential negative side-effects with this change. It solves the immediate problem for me locally, but there is probably more due diligence to be done here, and I'd :heart: some guidance on the best way to ensure this change is solid. \r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change. Changes that are unrelated should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message. Ex: `[Fix #issue-number]`\r\n* **N/A** Tests are added or updated if you fix a bug or add a feature.\r\n* **N/A** CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature. Minor bug fixes and documentation changes should not be included.\r\n",

Install MySQL >=8.3\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nbrew install mysql # at this time, installs 8.3.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. (Attempt to) Install dependencies\r\n\r\n```sh\r\ncd rails\r\nbundle install\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. Note the errors, specifically:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nclient.c:1438:3: error: call to undeclared function 'mysql_ssl_set'; ISO C99 and later do not support implicit function declarations\r\n[-Wimplicit-function-declaration]\r\n  mysql_ssl_set(wrapper->client,\r\n  ^\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\n`bundle install` succeeds unceremoniously\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nBundler fails to install `mysql2` with the following error:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nclient.c:1438:3: error: call to undeclared function 'mysql_ssl_set'; ISO C99 and later do not support implicit function declarations\r\n[-Wimplicit-function-declaration]\r\n  mysql_ssl_set(wrapper->client,\r\n  ^\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nI don't think this is specific to my system (although specs are listed below). My understanding of the issue (after poking around the interwebs the last couple evenings) stems from the fact that MySQL@8.3 removes a few APIs that the `mysql2` gem relied upon. This is fixed in the next patch release of `brianmario/mysql2` ([v0.5.6](https://github.com/brianmario/mysql2/releases/tag/0.5.6)). Simply upgrading this gem locally allows `bundle install` to pass as expected, although I'm not familiar enough with the Rails project to properly triage any potential side-effects.\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\n**Rails version**: Edge\r\n\r\n**Ruby version**: ruby 3.3.0 (2023-12-25 revision 5124f9ac75) [x86_64-darwin22]\r\n\r\n#### System specs (if it helps):\r\n\r\nMac OSX 12.6.3 (22G436)\r\n**CPU:** 2.8 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i7\r\n**GPU:** Intel HD Graphics 630 1536MB\r\n**RAM:** 16 GB 2133 MHz LPDDR3",

So, I'm not terribly sure what _should_ be listed here, but at the very least, this change unblocks the GitHub Actions workflow.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change.

The [security announcement](https://discuss.rubyonrails.org/t/possible-xss-vulnerability-in-action-controller/84947) makes no mention of backporting those fixes to 6-1-stable. See also: @radar's #51190.\r\n\r\nThat's the background. I'd say my motivation is that I'd like to unblock myself and anyone else waiting for the backport.\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nThis Pull Request applies existing commits in the 7-0-stable branch related to resolving CVE-2024-26143. Applying the fixes did require(ish?) backporting the `ActiveSupport::HtmlSafeTranslation` module. I suppose the patches could be applied without adding that module, but that was the easiest path I could identify.\r\n\r\nMost of the cherry picking introduced conflicts that I resolved by hand to the best of my ability. I'm certainly open to feedback on that approach or on any additional changes that should be made.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change.

We should be encouraging that for new applications. Especially for newcomers to the framework who might otherwise make rookie mistakes. So let's add it in the same way we just added Rubocop. --skip-brakeman if you don't want it, otherwise we add to default gemfile and create a default binstub in bin/brakeman.\r\n- PR for adding Brakeman opened by @vipulnsward https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/50507 at 31st Dec 2023\r\n- issue opened by @dhh: https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/50502 at 31st Dec 2023\r\n- issue opened by @dhh: https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/50508 at 1st Jan 2024\r\n\r\n\r\n## Background:\r\nRails license:\r\n![Screenshot 2024-02-26 at 15 43 52](https://github.com/rails/rails/assets/99652987/16b7f622-b56f-4dde-949d-399d01450eab)\r\n\r\nRuby on Rails is only using permissive licenses currently: MIT, BSD, APACHE.

That makes https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/50793 a bit harder to achieve, but not the end of the world.",

Minor bug fixes and documentation changes should not be included.\r\n",

This could be useful if the gem is being actively developed.\r\n\r\nThe documentation of Zeitwerk [warns](https://github.com/fxn/zeitwerk?tab=readme-ov-file#rules-of-thumb) this may be tricky:\r\n\r\n> In a given process, ideally, there should be at most one loader with reloading enabled. Technically, you can have more, but it may get tricky if one refers to constants managed by the other one. Do that only if you know what you are doing.\r\n\r\nIn the proposed use case, the application refers to constants in the gem, and the gem does not refer to constants from the application.

This means that if a record is saved multiple times in a transaction block, upon committing there might be fields changes persisted upon committing that are not included in `previous_changes`. \r\n\r\nThis becomes a problem if we are relying on `previous_changes` to conditionally execute code in an `after_commit`. Anecdotally this has lead to silent skipping of execution in some important `after_commit`s because of this non-obvious behavior.\r\n\r\nThis has been discussed before but the [issue link](https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/27661#issuecomment-274983095) is broken. Im very curious what was discussed\r\n\r\n### Request\r\neither\r\n- change `previous_changes` implementation to accumulate changes over multiple saves in the lifecycle of the AR instance\r\n- add a method like `previous_changes` that does this\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n<!-- (Guidelines for creating a bug report are [available\r\nhere](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/contributing_to_ruby_on_rails.html#creating-a-bug-report)) -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Paste your executable test case created from one of the scripts found [here](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/contributing_to_ruby_on_rails.html#create-an-executable-test-case) below: -->\r\n```ruby\r\nclass User < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n  t.string : first_name\r\n  t.string : last_name\r\nend\r\n\r\n# init record\r\nuser = User.new(first_name: 'Jeff', last_name: 'Bezos')\r\nuser.save! \r\n\r\nApplicationRecord.transaction do\r\n  employee.first_name = 'Bill'\r\n  employee.save! # same behavior for update!\r\n  employee.last_name = 'Gates'\r\n  employee.save!\r\nend\r\n\r\n# expected previous_changes.keys --> [\"first_name\", \"last_name\"]\r\nprint(employee.previous_changes.keys) # actual output --> [\"last_name\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n**Rails version**: 7.0.8.1\r\n\r\n**Ruby version**: 3.3.0\r\n",

This can cause someone upgrading an app that was created with Rails 7.0 to 7.1 to think that they are \"safe\" because they are already using SHA256, when they are not.\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nThis Pull Request changes the upgrade guide (`guides/source/upgrading_ruby_on_rails.md`) by mentioning that SHA-1 was the default `config.active_record.encryption.hash_digest_class` before Rails 7.1, not Rails 7.0.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nSee https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#config-active-record-encryption-hash-digest-class . This configuration guide is correct. We just needed to fix the upgrade guide to make it match with it.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change. Changes that are unrelated should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message. Ex: `[Fix #issue-number]`\r\n* [x] ~Tests are added or updated if you fix a bug or add a feature.~\r\n* [x] ~CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature. Minor bug fixes and documentation changes should not be included.~\r\n",

We didn't account for invalid URIs though, and it changes the behaviour of redirect_to to raise URI errors when we try to filter a bad URI. Instead, we should fallback to filtering bad URIs entirely to preserve behaviour.\r\n\r\nThis Pull Request has been created because rails/rails#51131 changes the behaviour of redirection, and I'm concerned it will break applications.\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nThis Pull Request changes redirect filtering to fallback to filtering the entire URI when we can't parse the URI.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nWe seem to do this for permitted host checking etc, so I think this is the correct behaviour.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change. Changes that are unrelated should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message. Ex: `[Fix #issue-number]`\r\n* [x] Tests are added or updated if you fix a bug or add a feature.\r\n* [ ] CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature. Minor bug fixes and documentation changes should not be included.\r\n",

This leaves an orphaned record in the child table.\r\ni.e. as a result, our `test_delegated_type_update_with_purchasable_attributes` test fails because the number of child records (namely `DigitalGood`) has changed.\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n**Rails version**: Rails 7.1.3.2\r\n\r\n**Ruby version**: ruby 3.1.2p20 (2022-04-12 revision 4491bb740a) [arm64-darwin22]\r\n",

One of these is `update_columns`, which in addition to skipping validations also skips callbacks and doesn't update timestamps. This is explained in the method doc at https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Persistence.html#method-i-update_columns but should also be mentioned there.\r\n\r\nOther listed methods likely do something similar.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nDocs should mention what other consequences there are to using these methods apart from just skipping validations. Might be fine to just put this as a general note, urging the user to look up the docs for the method they are intersted in using.\r\n Maybe method docs can be linked to directly from the list instead of just using method name code blocks?",

What bug have you fixed? What feature have you added? Why is it important?\r\nIf you are fixing a specific issue, include \"Fixes #ISSUE\" (replace with the issue number, remove the quotes) and the issue will be linked to this PR.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/51129.\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nWhen using composite primary keys in a model, the `primary_key` will be an array. This raises an issue when calling the `<association>_ids` method on a preloaded association. Internally, Rails uses the `pluck` method from Enumerable to retrieve the preloaded results. However, the `pluck` method does not accept an array as its argument. To accommodate that, we need to use the splat operator to split the array into multiple arguments dynamically.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n<!-- Provide additional information such as benchmarks, reference to other repositories or alternative solutions. -->\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change. Changes that are unrelated should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message. Ex: `[Fix #issue-number]`\r\n* [x] Tests are added or updated if you fix a bug or add a feature.\r\n* [x] CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature. Minor bug fixes and documentation changes should not be included.\r\n",

        "body": "### Motivation / Background\r\n\r\nSELECT queries are idempotent and thus safe to retry automatically. This commit leverages `allow_retry` to enable automatic retries on queries that go through `ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdaptersDatabaseStatements#select`.\r\n\r\nThis should help with connection-related exceptions stemming from network issues. Notably, at Shopify, our applications have been encountering sporadic `Trilogy::EOFError` exceptions on finds / relation loads. \r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nPass `allow_retry: true` when calling `#internal_exec_query` from `ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdaptersDatabaseStatements#select`.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nThere was discussion around retrying UPDATE and DELETE queries as well. This is potentially still valuable, though most Active Record updates and deletes are wrapped inside transactions that are retry-able anyways. Retrying `SELECT` queries will make a far more significant difference, so we're proposing we start by making these queries retry-able.\r\n\r\nWe'd also like to make the case to backport this to `7-1-stable`: some of Shopify's Rails applications are having trouble moving to trilogy because connection-related exceptions have been popping up, and the DB adapter hasn't been able to retry + reconnect. It's unclear why Trilogy in particular is experiencing these issues, but Trilogy is not usable for some of our applications without these changes. Making this available in the next patch release would help.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [X] This Pull Request is related to one change.

In these scenarios, most if not all of the schema-changes are created to target the sharded DB schemas, not the _primary_ one.\r\n\r\nMaking the default database migrations point to, configurable, simplifies developer experience.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nThe lack of this configuration option is making Shopify to monkey patch the `MigrationGenerator` class.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change. Changes that are unrelated should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message. Ex: `[Fix #issue-number]`\r\n* [x] Tests are added or updated if you fix a bug or add a feature.\r\n* [x] CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature. Minor bug fixes and documentation changes should not be included.\r\n",

Define a `has_and_belongs_to_many` relationship on a model, for example\r\n```ruby\r\nclass Apple < ApplicationRecord\r\n  has_and_belongs_to_many :oranges\r\nend\r\n```\r\n2. Setup the relationship using `create_join_table` in a migration file\r\n3. Write code to use the relationship such as\r\n```ruby\r\n# file.rb\r\nApple.joins(:oranges).first #line 1\r\n```\r\n4. Use `schema_format = :sql`\r\n5. Run the migration from step 2 to update db/structure.sql\r\n6. Roll the database back\r\n7. Run `bin/rails zeitwerk:check`\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n7. \"All is good!\" output\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n6. This is output:\r\n```\r\nActiveRecord::StatementInvalid: PG::UndefinedTable: ERROR:  relation \"oranges_apples\" does not exist\r\nLINE 1: ...* FROM \"apples\" INNER JOIN \"oranges...\r\n\r\n/Users/person/file.rb:1\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Commentary\r\nThe obvious solution is to run the migration. However, it's not always possible to run the migration before running some other code that Zeitwerk will eager load on. For example in a production scenario I need to build the deployment and then run the migration later through the built deployment code. During asset precompilation in the build phase I am seeing the above style of error in connection with this kind of error:\r\n\r\n```\r\n       ERROR in ./app/javascript/other/afile1.js.erb\r\n       Module build failed (from ./node_modules/rails-erb-loader/index.js):\r\n       Error: rails-erb-loader failed with code: 1\r\n           at ChildProcess.<anonymous> (/tmp/build_6e8198a8/node_modules/rails-erb-loader/index.js:128:16)\r\n           at ChildProcess.emit (node:events:514:28)\r\n           at maybeClose (node:internal/child_process:1105:16)\r\n           at ChildProcess._handle.onexit (node:internal/child_process:305:5)\r\n        @ ./app/javascript/application.js 5:187-232\r\n       \r\n       webpack 5.76.3 compiled with 1 error in 10796 ms\r\n```\r\n\r\n@fxn \r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n**Rails version**: 7.0.8\r\n\r\n**Ruby version**: 3.1.4\r\n",

I totally understand the compatibility argument, but this makes https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/50793 way harder (if not impossible) to achieve. Unless we introduce some (private?) alternative to `.connection` which essentially does the same but doesn't extend the lease.",

An array column would treat that array as the value to search for, so it'd be natural to expect an array of arrays would result in an `IN` query. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case as `where(name: [[value1], [value2]])` would return `name = {{value1}, {value2}}` in SQL, instead of `name IN ({value1}, {value2})`.\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nThat behavior stemmed from the fact that Active Record would force equality comparison for array columns if the value was an array. In order to allow `IN` queries this check was change to check whether it's a **one-dimensional** array by checking that the first item of is not an array.\r\n\r\nAfter these changes the following logic applies for querying array columns:\r\n\r\n1. Using a one-dimensional array results in an ordinary equality query.\r\n2. Using a two-dimensional array produces an `IN` query.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change.

This critical step can be overlooked because it's an additive change in a situation where code is typically being removed from a codebase, and trying to prevent this situation with linters and automated tests is tricky.\r\n\r\nIt would be great to be able to lean in the opposite direction by explicitly defining which columns the model has access to, similar to how we define strong params. When it's time to remove a column from the db, the column name is removed from `permitted_columns` and all of its references are removed from the model, eliminating the need to modify `ignored_columns`.\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nThis Pull Request adds `permitted_columns` and `permitted_columns=` to `ActiveRecord::ModelSchema`, which acts as an inverse to `ignored_columns`. When set, only columns specified in `permitted_columns` will be referenced by the model.  If a column name is specified in both `permitted_columns` and `ignored_columns`, then it is ignored. \r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change.

A similar initiative was discussed and implemented in [PR #49702](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/49702), which underscores the value of making the application name more user-friendly in the generated HTML.\r\n\r\nThis modification results in more human-readable titles for new applications. For example, an application generated with `rails new club_invoces` would have a title of `Club Invoces` instead of the less readable `ClubInvoces`.\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nTo address this, the proposed change involves modifying the title generation logic to replace camel casing with spaces, thus improving the readability of the application name in the title tag.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nThis change is straightforward and focuses solely on improving the default user experience with minimal impact on the existing codebase. It aligns with Rails' philosophy, providing sensible defaults that meet the expectations of the majority of developers.\r\n\r\nAlso, I fixed the regex introduced in [PR #49702](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/49702), as it was not testing what it should test: `title` tag only.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change.

What bug have you fixed? What feature have you added? Why is it important?\r\nIf you are fixing a specific issue, include \"Fixes #ISSUE\" (replace with the issue number, remove the quotes) and the issue will be linked to this PR.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis Pull Request has been created because I believe (at least based on my testing) that the example of creating an Entry using the delegated type is incorrect because it is missing a parameter. In the example, the `Entry` model has a `belongs_to :account` association declared, however the example of creating an Entry with a Comment `Entry.create! entryable: Comment.new(content: \"Hello!\"), creator: Current.user` provides a Creator but no Account. The factory models below that example also require modification.\r\n\r\nAppreciate this may have been written this way for specific reasons, or I maybe incorrect in my understanding. I do think most lesser-experienced developers (myself included) appreciate when provided examples more-or-less work as defined (i.e. can be copied and pasted in the console and work without modification).\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\n* Include the `account` kwarg in the `Entry.create!` example\r\n* Include the `account` kwarg in the `Entry::create_with_comment` example.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n<!-- Provide additional information such as benchmarks, reference to other repositories or alternative solutions. -->\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change. Changes that are unrelated should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message. Ex: `[Fix #issue-number]`\r\n* [x] Tests are added or updated if you fix a bug or add a feature.\r\n* [x] CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature. Minor bug fixes and documentation changes should not be included.\r\n",

Attaching a file should result in an attached file.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\n`query_constraints` route results in an attempt to query non-existing columns on `active_storage_attachments`. Redefining relations on a model doesn't help, since inverse `belong_to` association then attempts to compare two columns to one in `ActiveRecord::AutosaveAssociation#compute_primary_key`.\r\n\r\nComposite primary key route doesn't work, unless the key contains `:id` column.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nThis is kind-of solvable by adding exttra columns to `active_storage_attachments`, but that can get out of hand real fast.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, allowing `belongs_to` to accept an array `primary_key`, would solve the problem by letting the record have a regular `id` for use by ActiveSupport, but configure relations between models using composite keys. Right now, [this route doesn't work](https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/50850) due to `ActiveRecord::Reflection::BelongsToReflection#association_primary_key` transforming `primary_key` option with `to_s`.\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\n**Rails version**: 7.1.3\r\n\r\n**Ruby version**: 3.3.0",

        "body": "### Motivation / Background\r\n\r\nThe new AllowBrowser feature was added in #50505 . It permits setting minimum browser versions for an application, defines and documents a `:modern` version-set as requiring a list of certain features, and adds that option to the default config for new apps.\r\n\r\nThis PR has been created to make two minor corrections to `:modern`, one to its versions, one to its documentation.\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\n1. In 24264baeae1d57743aa87b4fcb88e55a42cc850a, adjust the `:modern` browser versions to match the description of required features. Specifically, CSS nesting isn't supported by Chrome until 120, Opera until 106 ([1](https://caniuse.com/css-nesting), [2](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Nesting_selector#browser_compatibility)).\r\n2. In ff0291291a2c93f40c92a306f4fc3025bd8bdbc0, remove badging from the documentation's list of required features, because it's still a [spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/badging/) that isn't fully implemented by any current browser ([1](https://caniuse.com/mdn-api_notification_badge), [2](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Badging_API#browser_compatibility)).\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nPersonally I'm not convinced this feature will be a good default for new apps, but if it's going to be offered, it should be correct for its stated purpose.\r\n\r\nFor fun, I benchmarked `UserAgent.parse.browser` on my laptop and it runs in about 40 microseconds, which is faster than I'd expected. But the runtime `require \"useragent\"` added 30 milliseconds to the first request.\r\n\r\nThe `useragent` gem was [last updated](https://github.com/gshutler/useragent) five years ago, and its browser recognition code is all [7 to 9 years old](https://github.com/gshutler/useragent/tree/master/lib/user_agent/browsers). It seems inappropriate to have a `:modern` default that doesn't recognize Edge (2015). There's a [fork by art19](https://github.com/art19/useragent) that recognizes Edge, but it adds 54 other browsers too, so it has 4x the LoC, and its `require` is 90 milliseconds. Something in-between might be nice.\r\n\r\nI made a [google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13hz5ndUBDeTqAKwYCv5CyAMGpcCVkc5hwJ7Is7BG0qo/edit#gid=0) listing browser versions that support each of the `:modern` features listed. The tl;dr is that badges and css nesting are the most-restrictive requirement for every major browser except Firefox (which was late to support css :has).",

Why is it important?\r\nIf you are fixing a specific issue, include \"Fixes #ISSUE\" (replace with the issue number, remove the quotes) and the issue will be linked to this PR.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis Pull Request has been created because I've found the `.with()` method to be a little overly restrictive - in particular, I would like to be able to name the columns of the CTE, which would allow me to use expressions without column names (e.g. `VALUES`).\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nSupport for the `.with` query method was added in https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/37944\r\n\r\nThe hash based syntax added in that PR supports Relations, Arel SelectManagers, and SqlLiterals as expressions, but only allows simple names for the CTEs.\r\n\r\nIn some circumstances, it's useful to be able to name the columns of the CTE as well as the table.\r\n\r\nFor example, if the expression is a ValuesList:\r\n\r\n    WITH magic(a, b, c) AS (VALUES (2, 6, 7), (9, 5, 1), (4, 3, 8))\r\n    SELECT a + b + c FROM magic;\r\n\r\n... we need to be able to name the columns in order to reference them later.\r\n\r\nOne use case for having this supported in ActiveRecord's with query method is joining the results from a previous query to a subsequent one. For example, if you were walking through an org chart, but you couldn't use recursive CTEs, you could use this approach to keep information about the management path:\r\n\r\n    big_bosses = Employee.where(manager: nil).pluck(id)\r\n\r\n    first_level = Employee.with(Arel::Nodes::Cte.new(\r\n        Arel.sql(\"bosses(id)\"),\r\n        Arel::Nodes::Grouping.new(Arel::Nodes::ValuesList.new(big_bosses))\r\n      )\r\n      .joins(\"INNER JOIN employees ON emplooyees.manager = bosses.id\")\r\n      .pluck(\"employees.id\", \"bosses.id\")\r\n\r\n    second_level = Employee.with(Arel::Nodes::Cte.new(\r\n        Arel.sql(\"bosses(id, grand_boss_id)\"),\r\n        Arel::Nodes::Grouping.new(Arel::Nodes::ValuesList.new(first_level))\r\n      )\r\n      .joins(\"INNER JOIN employees ON emplooyees.manager = bosses.id\")\r\n      .pluck(\"employees.id\", \"bosses.id\", \"bosses.grand_boss_id\")\r\n\r\n    ... and so on ... (not tested)\r\n\r\nI'm not sure about this use case particularly, but I imagine there are a few other situations where it's useful to have more control over the name of the CTE than we currently have.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/37944 (original PR to add the `.with()` query method)\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change. Changes that are unrelated should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message. Ex: `[Fix #issue-number]`\r\n* [x] Tests are added or updated if you fix a bug or add a feature.\r\n* [ ] CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature. Minor bug fixes and documentation changes should not be included.\r\n",

Say you have a constraint like this one:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nget '(*path)', to: \"domains#redirect\", constraints: ->(request) do\r\n  request.host != 'myservice.com'\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n(Things such a `DomainsController` might do: Redirect \"www.myservice.com\" to \"myservice.com\" or redirect shortcuts such as \"yourproject.myservice.com\" to \"myservice.com/yourproject\".)\r\n\r\nWith such an entry in `routes.rb`, the mock request misbehaves because it is only fed with the `path` and therefore uses the [hardcoded fallback server name](https://github.com/rack/rack/blob/ae7d6a171963a70918b4e43525408c571a3f28fe/lib/rack/mock_request.rb#L105) \"example.org\". And since `\"example.org\" != \"myservice.com\"`, the remainder of `recognize_path` works off the wrong route.\r\n\r\nThe solution is quite simple, something along the lines of:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n# replace...\r\nenv = Rack::MockRequest.env_for(path, method: method)\r\n\r\n# with...\r\nenv = Rack::MockRequest.env_for(url_helpers.root_url.delete(r{/$}) + path, method: method)\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy passing the real URL instead of just the path, the mock request no longer uses the fallback but hits the router as a real request would.\r\n\r\nI'll work around this for now and take a look at the corresponding tests to check whether I can solder together a PR.\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n**Rails version**: 6.1.7.6 (but the code hasn't changed on `main` as of today)\r\n\r\n**Ruby version**: 3.1.4\r\n",

Construct an Arel node instead.`\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\n`#reduce` returns `nil` when operating on empty collections. This commit adds a separate branch for handling an empty query set in `PredicateBuilder#grouping_queries`.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change.

What bug have you fixed? What feature have you added? Why is it important?\r\nIf you are fixing a specific issue, include \"Fixes #ISSUE\" (replace with the issue number, remove the quotes) and the issue will be linked to this PR.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFixes #33155\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nUpdates `#load_target` in `ActiveRecord::Associations::CollectionAssociation` and `ActiveRecord::Associations::Association` (which is inherited by `ActiveRecord::Associations::SingularAssociation`) to set the through association target using the middle record when the current record has not yet been persisted.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n<!-- Provide additional information such as benchmarks, reference to other repositories or alternative solutions. -->\r\n\r\nI usually include coverage before opening a PR but I'd like some initial feedback on this before I do that given that it's a change to a core part of AR and I'm not certain that a patch will be accepted for this issue. However, I've got [a reproduction script](https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/33155#issuecomment-1949912960) which passes against this branch.\r\n\r\nThere also seems to have been [another attempted patch](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/38562) which didn't end up getting merged.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change. Changes that are unrelated should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message. Ex: `[Fix #issue-number]`\r\n* [ ] Tests are added or updated if you fix a bug or add a feature.\r\n* [ ] CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature. Minor bug fixes and documentation changes should not be included.\r\n",

At least with that you could, for example, check `date_range.end.to_s == 'Infinity'` for some kind of logical checking for an infinite range start or end.\r\n\r\nReturning nil seems to be undocumented change in behavior at the very least.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\nThe date range returns a nil object for whichever end of the range may be infinite.\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n**Rails version**: 7.1.3\r\n\r\n**Ruby version**: 3.2.2\r\n\r\n",

What bug have you fixed? What feature have you added? Why is it important?\r\nIf you are fixing a specific issue, include \"Fixes #ISSUE\" (replace with the issue number, remove the quotes) and the issue will be linked to this PR.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWhile `fields_for` currently accepts a lambda as an argument for `child_index`, that lambda is called without any arguments. Being that we are enumerating the association on `fields_for` at the time the lambda is called, we have an opportunity to pass the child of the association down to the lambda.  This could simplify the case where you may want to use the `id` of an Active Record object as the index.  So with this change you could do something like this:\r\n\r\n```html.erb\r\n<%= author_form.fields_for :books, child_index: ->(book) { book.id } do |book_form| %>\r\n  <%= book_form.text_field :name %>\r\n<% end %>\r\n```\r\n\r\nPrior to this, you would have had to enumerate the association yourself:\r\n\r\n```html.erb\r\n<% author.books.each do |book| %>\r\n  <%= author_form.fields_for :books, book, child_index: book.id do |book_form| %>\r\n    <%= book_form.text_field :name %>\r\n  <% end %>\r\n<% end %>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nAccepts passing the association's child as an argument in a lambda as the `child_index` option in `fields_for`.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nUsed [PR 19661](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/19661) as a guide when passing a lambda to `child_index` was originally introduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Provide additional information such as benchmarks, reference to other repositories or alternative solutions. -->\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change. Changes that are unrelated should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message. Ex: `[Fix #issue-number]`\r\n* [x] Tests are added or updated if you fix a bug or add a feature.\r\n* [x] CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature. Minor bug fixes and documentation changes should not be included.\r\n",

This leads to errors like `ActionController::RoutingError` polluting error trackers while not being actionable since they do not represent an exceptional situation.\r\n\r\nThis commit changes the behavior to only report errors that are not considered \"handled\" based on the `ActionDispatch::ExceptionWrapper.rescue_responses` list.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Alternative solution\r\nWhat I have considered and what might actually be a better solution for the long-term is to report \"handled\" exceptions as `handled: true`. This way subscribers can decide how they want to proceed reporting something that has already been handled. Example: While I strongly believe that `ActionController::RoutingError` should not be presented on the error tracker in the same way as something like `raise \"boom\"`, I can see that some applications may want to soft-report them in a way that doesn't trigger any alerts and doesn't require any attention. For example It's totally expected to have `ActionController::RoutingError` exceptions but if the number of `ActionController::RoutingError` spikes it may indicate that either some link that used to be accessible became unaccessible or a wrong link was posted/rendered somewhere which makes such event actionable and worth reporting. \r\n\r\n\r\nBut regardless, `ActionController::RoutingError` (and similar) exceptions should not suddenly be reported as part of a patch version upgrade. It should be a major change with perhaps a configuration option to allow applications to adapt and make a decision on how to proceed. \r\n\r\nI'm open for the discussion and eager to learn what are yours expectations on this behavior!

        "body": "### Motivation / Background\r\n\r\n`ActiveRecord::Encryption::MessageSerializer` creates serialized JSON. The JSON values are Base64 encoded to ensure that the data can stored in text database columns without encoding issues. \r\n\r\nBinary columns however can store arbitrary data, so won't have the encoding issues. By using a MessagePack based serializer we can store data more efficiently without the Base64 overhead (about 33%).\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nAdd a new serializer `ActiveRecord::Encryption::MessagePackMessageSerializer` that serializes encrypted data to the MessagePack format, for efficient storage in binary columns.\r\n\r\nTo prevent it being used with text columns, validate that we only try to store binary data in binary columns.\r\n\r\nThe serializer is not autoloaded, because it relies on the optional msgpack gem.\r\n\r\nUsage:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nrequire \"activerecord/encryption/message_pack_message_serializer`\r\n\r\nclass Foo < ApplicationRecord\r\n  encrypts :bar, message_serializer: ActiveRecord::Encryption::MessagePackMessageSerializer.new\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change. Changes that are unrelated should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message. Ex: `[Fix #issue-number]`\r\n* [x] Tests are added or updated if you fix a bug or add a feature.\r\n* [x] CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature. Minor bug fixes and documentation changes should not be included.\r\n",

It is a technique to avoid the dog pile effect (aka cache stampede) by expiring the cache before the TTL.\r\n\r\nI implemented this method based on the paper[^1] which uses probabilistic decision with the exponential function `Exp(λ)` and demonstrates to be optimal.\r\n\r\n[^1]: [Vattani, A.; Chierichetti, F.; Lowenstein, K. (2015), Optimal Probabilistic Cache Stampede Prevention, Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment, VLDB](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~avattani/papers/cache_stampede.pdf)\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\n1. Add new option `early_expiration` to `ActiveSupport::Cache::Store#fetch`.\r\n2. Add new method `ActiveSupport::Cache::Entry#should_expire_early?(beta: 1)`.\r\n4. Add new instance variable `@generation_time` to `ActiveSupport::Cache::Entry`.\r\n\r\nHere is a simple implementation to illustrate the approach:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\ndef x_fetch(key, ttl, beta = 1)\r\n  value, delta, expiry = read(key)\r\n  if value.nil? || Time.now − delta * beta * Math.log(rand) ≥ expiry\r\n    start = Time.now\r\n    value = yield\r\n    delta = Time.now – start\r\n    write(key, value, delta, ttl)\r\n  end\r\n  return value\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nI created a stacked histogram comparing the stampede sizes between `:race_condition_ttl` (fetch) and `:early_expiration` (x_fetch):\r\n\r\n![800k_histogram](https://github.com/rails/rails/assets/809410/01dc5a69-4206-458e-ad76-c52637f9f00b)\r\n\r\nAs the histogram shows, `:early_expiration` has smaller stampede size compared to `:race_condition_ttl`.\r\n\r\nFor the definition of \"the stampede sizes\", please refer to [the paper](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~avattani/papers/cache_stampede.pdf).\r\n\r\nNote that the benchmark is generated using 16 threads. The difference could be more significant with higher number of threads.\r\n\r\nFor more information, please refer to the [benchmark repository](https://github.com/tonytonyjan/rails_cache_stampede_benchmark).\r\n\r\nThe benchmark repository: https://github.com/tonytonyjan/rails_cache_stampede_benchmark\r\nThe paper: https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~avattani/papers/cache_stampede.pdf\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change. Changes that are unrelated should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why.

Changes that are unrelated should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message. Ex: `[Fix #issue-number]`\r\n* [x] Tests are added or updated if you fix a bug or add a feature.\r\n* [x] CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature. Minor bug fixes and documentation changes should not be included.\r\n",

What bug have you fixed? What feature have you added? Why is it important?\r\nIf you are fixing a specific issue, include \"Fixes #ISSUE\" (replace with the issue number, remove the quotes) and the issue will be linked to this PR.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nPrevents conflicts by only setting LD_PRELOAD if it's not already defined, the script avoids potential issues with overriding existing values and ensures compatibility with other tools or libraries that might rely on specific LD_PRELOAD settings.\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nThis pull request proposes a change to the Docker entrypoint script in the Rails codebase to prevent potential issues with overriding the LD_PRELOAD environment variable if it's already set.\r\n\r\nThe current script includes a line that sets LD_PRELOAD to include the path to libjemalloc.so.2 if the library exists. However, this approach doesn't consider the possibility that LD_PRELOAD might already be defined with other values for different purposes. In such cases, blindly appending libjemalloc.so.2 could lead to unexpected behavior or conflicts.\r\n\r\nTo address this concern, the pull request introduces a modification that checks if LD_PRELOAD is already set before adding libjemalloc.so.2. This ensures that the existing value remains intact while still allowing the inclusion of jemalloc if it's not already present.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n<!-- Provide additional information such as benchmarks, reference to other repositories or alternative solutions. -->\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change. Changes that are unrelated should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message. Ex: `[Fix #issue-number]`\r\n* [x] Tests are added or updated if you fix a bug or add a feature.\r\n* [x] CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature. Minor bug fixes and documentation changes should not be included.\r\n",

        "body": "**Motivation / Background**\r\n\r\nCurrently, the `where.associated` method in Rails only allows filtering associated records with an `inner join`, which can potentially override existing join types in the query. The fix ensures that the association is joined using the appropriate join type (either inner join or left outer join) based on the existing joins in the scope. This prevents unintentional overrides of existing join types and ensures consistency in the generated SQL queries.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n User.left_outer_joins(:orders).where.associated(:orders).count\r\n```\r\nOld query\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT COUNT(*) FROM \"users\" INNER JOIN \"orders\" ON \"orders\".\"user_id\" = \"users\".\"id\" WHERE \"orders\".\"id\" IS NOT NULL\r\n```\r\nafter fixing the issue, the query:\r\nNew Query\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT COUNT(*) FROM \"users\" LEFT OUTER JOIN \"orders\" ON \"orders\".\"user_id\" = \"users\".\"id\" WHERE \"orders\".\"id\" IS NOT NULL\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis enhancement empowers developers with greater flexibility in querying associated data, facilitating scenarios such as:\r\n\r\n- Retrieving posts with authors, even if some posts lack an assigned author (utilizing left_joins).\r\n- Obtaining comments associated with specific users, encompassing orphaned comments without a user (employing multiple joins with varied types).\r\n\r\n**Detail**\r\n\r\nThe pivotal improvement in this Pull Request is the inclusion of a check ensuring that associations are joined using the appropriate join type (either inner join or left outer join) based on existing joins within the scope. This safeguards against unintentional overrides of existing join types and fosters consistency in the generated SQL queries.\r\n\r\n**Additional Information**\r\n\r\nThis refinement is informed by common requirements articulated by Rails developers in various forums and discussions. Analogous functionality is prevalent in certain popular ORM extensions, underscoring its utility. The implementation is crafted to preserve clarity and coherence within the existing codebase.\r\n\r\nNote: This is a draft description and should be adapted to your specific implementation details and the project's context.\r\n\r\nFYI: After merging this PR, I will check the `missing` method and fix this issue in a separate PR alternative same PR.\r\n\r\n**Performance:**\r\n\r\n- Benchmark Before the fix:\r\n\r\n```\r\nBenchmark.ips do |x| \r\n  x.report('joins') { User.joins(:comments, :orders).where.associated(:orders) }\r\n  x.report('left_joins') { User.left_joins(:comments, :orders).where.associated(:orders) }\r\n  x.report('left_outer_joins') { User.left_outer_joins(:comments, :orders).where.associated(:orders) }\r\n  x.report('with out joins') { User.where.associated(:orders) }\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n```info\r\nWarming up --------------------------------------\r\n  joins                        3.260k i/100ms\r\n  left_joins                3.261k i/100ms\r\n  left_outer_joins     3.234k i/100ms\r\n  with out joins         3.518k i/100ms\r\nCalculating -------------------------------------\r\n  joins                         32.610k (± 0.7%) i/s -    166.260k in   5.098730s\r\n  left_joins                 32.240k (± 1.1%) i/s -    163.050k in   5.058117s\r\n  left_outer_joins      32.395k (± 0.5%) i/s -    164.934k in   5.091447s\r\n  with out joins          35.337k (± 0.6%) i/s -    179.418k in   5.077489s\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n- Benchmark After the fix:\r\n\r\n```\r\nBenchmark.ips do |x| \r\n  x.report('joins') { User.joins(:comments, :orders).where.associated(:orders) }\r\n  x.report('left_joins') { User.left_joins(:comments, :orders).where.associated(:orders) }\r\n  x.report('left_outer_joins') { User.left_outer_joins(:comments, :orders).where.associated(:orders) }\r\n  x.report('with out joins') { User.where.associated(:orders) }\r\nend\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nWarming up --------------------------------------\r\n  joins                          3.278k i/100ms\r\n  left_joins                  3.264k i/100ms\r\n  left_outer_joins       3.245k i/100ms\r\n  with out joins           3.434k i/100ms\r\nCalculating -------------------------------------\r\n  joins                           31.688k (± 3.8%) i/s -    160.622k in   5.076856s\r\n  left_joins                   32.432k (± 1.1%) i/s -    163.200k in   5.032760s\r\n  left_outer_joins        32.398k (± 1.4%) i/s -    162.250k in   5.009054s\r\n  with out joins            34.698k (± 1.3%) i/s -    175.134k in   5.048274s\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change.

Changes that are unrelated should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message. Ex: `[Fix #issue-number]`\r\n* [x] Tests are added or updated if you fix a bug or add a feature.\r\n* [ ] CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature. Minor bug fixes and documentation changes should not be included.\r\n",

Changes that are unrelated should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [ ] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message. Ex: `[Fix #issue-number]`\r\n* [ ] Tests are added or updated if you fix a bug or add a feature.\r\n* [ ] CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature.

It seem that the child models are saved and validated in every permutation possible. This PR results in every record being called at most 1 time and can significantly reduce CPU usage and time to save in this situations.\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nThis PR adds `memory` to ensure that each record only gets saved and/or validated only once while traversing the autosave tree, ensuring the changes are available after saving via the `previous_changes` method.\r\n\r\nFixes #28491.\r\n\r\n#28491 suggested adding a variable to avoid clearing the changes on the root record which worked; but would not fix the issue if the two models with the autosave true are related to another separate model that is being saved or updated.\r\n\r\nFixes #46438.\r\n\r\nThis PR also supplants #46438 and enhances it by being able to work across connections and increase speed by only allowing autosaved child models to be saved or validated only once.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change.

We saw all our database replicas stall out at times as a result:\r\n\r\n> In a busy database, it's possible for the size of the subtransaction log to grow so large that the working set no longer fits into memory. This results in a lot of cache misses, which in turn causes a high amount of disk I/O and CPU as PostgreSQL furiously tries to load data from disk to keep up with all the lookups.\r\n\r\nHas this been solved in PostgreSQL yet? No. The commits highlighted in https://postgres.ai/blog/20210831-postgresql-subtransactions-considered-harmful#ideas-for-postgresql-development haven't made it into PostgreSQL upstream yet. I see there is recent activity in this thread: https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/flat/CAFiTN-vzDvNz=ExGXz6gdyjtzGixKSqs0mKHMmaQ8sOSEFZ33A@mail.gmail.com\r\n\r\nFor now, we're going to patch ActiveRecord to revert the change, but I'd suggest reverting this or making it some option for those who really need to deal with the racy conditions outlined.\r\n",

This determines whether or not the distinct clause is applied to the relation. However, the argument isn't validated and is always treated as truthy or falsey (e.g. [in this condition](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/0f9aaa5ca9b8421ebf42b3d7720632d4c1cae5fc/activerecord/lib/active_record/relation.rb#L474)). This means that a non-boolean argument can be passed in with certain expectations (e.g. a column that's not the primary key expecting the query to result in a `DISTINCT ON`), but the `DISTINCT` clause will always only either apply or not apply on the base table's primary key.\r\n\r\nI've had to explain that passing (a truthy) argument this way doesn't change the outcome of the clause to junior engineers a couple of times, so I feel like this is something that should be validated.

It seems counter to the Rails ethos of leveraging conventions and defaults to actively suggest a bespoke customization.\r\n\r\nThis change now documents the existing default global `excludesFile` location instead.\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\n`git config core.excludesFile` defaults to `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-~/.config}/git/ignore`.\r\n\r\nThis Pull Request changes the .gitignore template in the rails app generator to suggest the default file location instead of configuring a custom location.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nThis is essentially a docs change as it only updates a code-comment in generator template.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change. Changes that are unrelated should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message. Ex: `[Fix #issue-number]`\r\n* [x] ~Tests are added or updated if you fix a bug or add a feature.~ n/a\r\n* [x] ~CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature. Minor bug fixes and documentation changes should not be included.~ n/a\r\n",

That misunderstanding is further clarified with a following phrase.\r\n\r\n> But this will _not_ stop the rest of the code in the `show` action from running\r\n\r\nThis section is often enough to get the point across for newer developers who might often be running into double render errors, but soon after the phrase which attempts the same illustration of `redirect_to`'s execution confuses the matter by using the same language as the earlier statement to mean the opposite.\r\n\r\n> Sometimes inexperienced developers think of `redirect_to` as a sort of `goto` command, moving execution from one place to another in your Rails code. This is _not_ correct. Your code stops running and waits for a new request from the browser.\r\n\r\nHere \"Your code stops running\" means that the action **_will_** run to completion and not jump to another site in controller code, where the other phrase \"stop the rest of the code ... from running\" is used to illustrate the misunderstanding and means the action **_will not_** run to completion. This often re-confuses the concept they've just learned and undermines their understanding. By being more specific in the second phrase, we can reinforce the concept instead.\r\n\r\n### The change\r\n\r\nOpen to feedback around the particular phrasing or formatting, the important part is changing the re-use of the \"stops ... running\" terminology.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change.

        "body": "(This PR supersedes #50928, which I'll close)\r\n\r\nThis fixes race condition in Active Storage when multiple preprocessed variants are defined for a `Previewable` file is attached.\r\n\r\n## Background\r\n\r\nWhen a variant is specified for a \"previewable\" file type (e.g. video  or PDF) attachment, a `preview_image` attachment is first created and attached on the original blob and then any user-specified variants are derived from _that_ preview image. When those variants are named and have `preprocessed: true`, the jobs to create those variants are queued simultaneously.\r\n\r\nExample from my case:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n  has_one_attached :file, dependent: :purge_later do |attachable|\r\n    attachable.variant :preview, resize_to_fill: [400, 400], preprocessed: true\r\n    attachable.variant :still, format: \"jpg\", saver: {quality: 85}, preprocessed: true\r\n  end\r\n```\r\n\r\n## The issue\r\n\r\nWhen a `Previewable` attachment is created (a video, in my case), `TransformJob.perform_later` is called for each named variant with `preprocessed: true`. Unless your queue adapter is synchronous (e.g. :inline or :test), this results in a race condition in which every such variant's worker will check `processed?`, see that no `preview_image` attachment exists yet on the `ActiveStorage::Blob`, and:\r\n\r\n1. Redundantly download the file from storage\r\n2. Create duplicative ActiveStorage::Attachment and `ActiveStorage::Blob` records for the `preview_image` attachment (all but one of which will be orphaned from the original blob's `has_one_attached :preview_image`)\r\n3. Create variant blobs (and associated `ActiveStorage::VariantRecord`) that are similarly orphaned (by virtue of being a variant of an orphaned `preview_image` blob)\r\n\r\nAs a result, if the video is ever purged, `PurgeJob` will only find the current `has_one_attached :preview_image` and whatever variant demanded it into existence, then leave the rest as orphaned records in the database and in storage.\r\n\r\n## The fix\r\n\r\nQueue a `PreviewImageJob` instead of N `TransformJob` jobs and have it, only after `preview_image` is attached, enqueue any subsequent `TransformJob` jobs\r\n\r\n## Testing caveat \r\n\r\nWriting a reproduction test case for this inside Rails would be difficult because it would require running the resulting TransformJob jobs concurrently. I [started a test](https://github.com/searls/rails/blob/fix-video-duplicate-preview-variants/activestorage/test/models/variant_with_record_test.rb#L348-L367) but failed to reproduce, in part because the test queue adapter will perform enqueued jobs inline instead of concurrently. In order to write a test that replicated the issue appropriately, we might first need a new option for `perform_enqueued_jobs(async: true) { … }`\r\n\r\nIf you're interested, [this gist](https://gist.github.com/searls/5b8298abe88b3206f670ea3c6d574aab) includes a driver script and output before and after the patch showing it working.\r\n\r\n## Evaluating impact on existing Active Storage users\r\n\r\nI only found this because I'm a total cheapskate and was literally counting records in my S3 bucket to ensure `PurgeJob` worked. Then I wasted the next two days trying to figure out why before landing on this. I strongly suspect that ActiveStorage users who host video and take advantage of `preprocessed: true` named variants will have a lot of orphaned stuff floating around their buckets.\r\n\r\nTo see if you have any such \"zombie\" preview_images (and presumably, associated variants) floating around your application that would survive calls to `purge` on the owning attachment, you could write a query like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nActiveStorage::Attachment\r\n  .joins(\"INNER JOIN active_storage_attachments as other_attachments ON\r\n          active_storage_attachments.record_id = other_attachments.record_id AND\r\n          active_storage_attachments.id != other_attachments.id\")\r\n  .where(\r\n    :name => \"preview_image\",\r\n    :record_type => \"ActiveStorage::Blob\",\r\n    \"other_attachments.name\" => \"preview_image\",\r\n    \"other_attachments.record_type\" => \"ActiveStorage::Blob\"\r\n  )\r\n  .distinct\r\n```\r\n\r\nClearing out one's production database and backend storage to get this all right-sized should be a fun exercise for the reader.",

Moving it here ensures errors are always reported regardless of the environment. \r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n<!-- Provide additional information such as benchmarks, reference to other repositories or alternative solutions. -->\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change. Changes that are unrelated should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message. Ex: `[Fix #issue-number]`\r\n* [x] Tests are added or updated if you fix a bug or add a feature.\r\n* [x] CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature. Minor bug fixes and documentation changes should not be included.\r\n",

Moving it here also ensures they are reported in development. Initially i had wanted it in ShowExceptions but in development DebugExceptions swallows it first. \r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n<!-- Provide additional information such as benchmarks, reference to other repositories or alternative solutions. -->\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change.

What's your opinion on making ruby the language to write the templates instead of html, and also write abstractions to reduce the need of js:\r\n\r\nHere's a quick look at how it works:\r\n\r\nFor controllers, pretty standard stuff:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass ItemsController < ApplicationController\r\n  def index\r\n    @items = Item.all\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  def show\r\n    item = Item.find(params[:id])\r\n    render Items::ShowPage.new(item:)\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then, instead of juggling between HTML and Ruby, you keep it all Ruby:\r\n\r\n`views/index.rb`\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nh1 \"Items\"\r\n\r\n@items.each do |item|\r\n  div do\r\n    link_to item.title, item_path(item)\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nspan \"Items count: #{@items.count}\"\r\n\r\n`pages/items/show_page`\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nmodule Items\r\n  class ShowPage\r\n    include ActivePage\r\n    attr_reader :item\r\n\r\n    def initialize(item:)\r\n      @item = item\r\n    end\r\n\r\n    def template\r\n      page_title\r\n      div class: 'card' do\r\n         div do\r\n            h3 item.title\r\n        \r\n            link_to \"Items\" items_path\r\n        \r\n            render Items::ItemDetailsComponent.new(item:)\r\n         end\r\n      end\r\n    end\r\n    \r\n    def page_title\r\n      h1 \"Show Item\", class: 'title'\r\n    end\r\n    \r\n    def style\r\n       {\r\n         h1: {\r\n            color: 'red'\r\n         }\r\n       }\r\n    end\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd you can define components like so:\r\n\r\n`components/items/item_details_component`\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nmodule Items\r\n  class ItemDetailsComponent\r\n    include ActiveComponent\r\n    \r\n    attr_reader :item\r\n\r\n    def initialize(item:)\r\n      @item = item\r\n    end\r\n\r\n    def template\r\n      table do\r\n        # Details go here\r\n      end\r\n    end\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\nI'm thinking this could really simplify how we handle views and frontend logic in Rails apps. Plus, it's Ruby through and through, which is always a plus\r\n\r\nAlso there is [matestack-ui-vuejs](https://github.com/matestack/matestack-ui-vuejs) which has some really interesting ways to hide the use of js.\r\n\r\nThis could pave the path to leveraging powerful component libraries similar to those available in React, such as Ant Design or Material-UI. While Hotwire offers a solid approach, the elegance of pure Ruby, coupled with its dynamic nature, allows us to utilize JSX-like templating effectively.\r\n\r\n@dhh",

Here's an [issue](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/issues/6742) from Bundler where this concept is explained more deeply.\r\n\r\nIn order to solve this, [Bundler 2.4.19](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/blob/master/bundler/CHANGELOG.md#2419-august-17-2023) adds the possibilty of specifying the Ruby version in the `Gemfile` by directly pointing to a file containing that version. This is the [PR](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/6876) that introduced such enhancement. \r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nWith that being said, having something like this in the `Gemfile` of a new Rails app:\r\n```rb\r\nruby file: \".ruby-version\"\r\n````\r\navoids duplication and can make life easier when upgrading Ruby.\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n<!-- Provide additional information such as benchmarks, reference to other repositories or alternative solutions. -->\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change. Changes that are unrelated should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message. Ex: `[Fix #issue-number]`\r\n* [ ] Tests are added or updated if you fix a bug or add a feature.\r\n* [ ] CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature. Minor bug fixes and documentation changes should not be included.\r\n",

But ther eare more subtle cases.\r\n\r\nThe general idea here is to ensure our transaction is correctly rolling back during teardown. If it fails, then we assume something might have mutated some of the inserted fixtures, so we invalidate the cache to ensure the next test will reset them.\r\n\r\nThis issue is particularly common in Active Record's own test suite since transaction fixtures are enabled by default but we have many tests create tables and such.\r\n\r\nWe could treat this case as an error, but since we can gracefully recover from it, I don't think it's worth it.\r\n",

        "body": "### Motivation / Background\r\n\r\nCurrently, there is no (simple) way to ask a model if it connects to a single database or to multiple shards. Furthermore, without looping through a model's connections, I don't believe there's an easy way to return a list of shards a model can connect to.\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nThis commit adds a `@shard_keys` ivar that's set whenever `.connects_to` is called. It sets the ivar to the result of `shards.keys`. `shards` in `.connects_to` defaults to an empty hash and therefore when calling `connects_to database: {...}` `@shard_keys` will be set to an empty array.\r\n\r\n`@shard_keys` is set _before_ the following lines:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nif shards.empty?\r\n  shards[:default] = database\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis conditional sets the one and only shard (`:default`) to the value of `database` that we pass to `.connects_to`. This allows for calling `connected_to(shard: :default)` on models configured to only connect to a database e.g.:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass UnshardedBase < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n  self.abstract_class = true\r\n\r\n  connects_to database: { writing: :primary }\r\nend\r\n\r\nclass UnshardedModel < UnshardedBase\r\nend\r\n\r\nUnshardedBase.connected_to(shard: :default) { UnshardedBase.connection_pool.db_config.name } => primary\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is ultimately still an _unsharded_ model which is why `@shard_keys` gets set before the conditional.\r\n\r\nWith the new `@shard_keys` ivar we need a way for descendants of the abstract AR model to return that same value. For that we leverage the existing `.connection_class_for_self` method. That method returns the ancestor of the model where `.connects_to` was called, or returns self if it's the connection class:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass UnshardedBase < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n  self.abstract_class = true\r\n\r\n  connects_to database: { writing: :primary }\r\nend\r\n\r\nclass UnshardedModel < UnshardedBase\r\nend\r\n\r\nActiveRecord::Base.connection_class_for_self => ActiveRecord::Base\r\n\r\nUnshardedBase.connection_class_for_self => UnshardedBase(abstract)\r\n\r\nUnshardedModel.connection_class_for_self => UnshardedBase(abstract)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe new `.shard_keys` method is a getter which returns the value of `@shard_keys` from the connection class or it returns an empty array. The empty array is necessary in cases where `connects_to` was never called.\r\n\r\nFinally, I've added an `.on_all_shards` method which takes all of the arguments for `.connected_to` except for `shard`. Instead, it loops through every shard key and then delegates everything else to `.connected_to`. I've used `.map` instead of `.each` so that we can collect the results of each block.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change.

        "body": "### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nPassing an array to the `model` parameter of `form_with` when the terminal resource in the array is singular _AND_ unpersisted generates an incorrect path. In the example below, ActionDispatch generates a named path of `posts_comments_path`, which does not exist because the routes defines a singular `comment` resource, so the valid path should be `posts_comments_path`.\r\n\r\nIn my testing, this issue only appears of the resource is unpersisted; so works fine if the form is updating a saved resource but not when creating a new resource. My own _highly_ inexperienced analysis discovered that the `PolymorphicRoutes` class will [return a singular resource path _if_ the resource is persisted](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/36c1591bcb5e0ee3084759c7f42a706fe5bb7ca7/actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/routing/polymorphic_routes.rb#L317). If the resource is new, then the code runs [this line to generate a plural path](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/36c1591bcb5e0ee3084759c7f42a706fe5bb7ca7/actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/routing/polymorphic_routes.rb#L321).\r\n\r\nI understand that this _might_ be an intentional design or may be justified for some reason beyond my understanding. Also, I appreciate that it may not be possible for ActionDispatch to be aware if the resource is singular or plural.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n# frozen_string_literal: true\r\n\r\nrequire \"bundler/inline\"\r\n\r\ngemfile(true) do\r\n  source \"https://rubygems.org\"\r\n\r\n  git_source(:github) { |repo| \"https://github.com/#{repo}.git\" }\r\n\r\n  gem \"rails\"\r\n  # If you want to test against edge Rails replace the previous line with this:\r\n  # gem \"rails\", github: \"rails/rails\", branch: \"main\"\r\n  gem 'sqlite3'\r\n  gem 'debug'\r\nend\r\n\r\n# require \"action_controller/railtie\"\r\nrequire \"active_record\"\r\nrequire \"action_view\"\r\n\r\n# This connection will do for database-independent bug reports.\r\nActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection(adapter: \"sqlite3\", database: \":memory:\")\r\nActiveRecord::Base.logger = Logger.new(STDOUT)\r\n\r\nActiveRecord::Schema.define do\r\n  create_table :posts, force: true do |t|\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  create_table :comments, force: true do |t|\r\n    t.integer :post_id\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n\r\nclass Post < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n  has_one :comment\r\nend\r\n\r\nclass Comment < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n  belongs_to :post\r\nend\r\n\r\nclass TestApp < Rails::Application\r\n  config.root = __dir__\r\n  config.hosts << \"example.org\"\r\n  config.secret_key_base = \"secret_key_base\"\r\n\r\n  config.logger = Logger.new($stdout)\r\n  Rails.logger  = config.logger\r\n\r\n  routes.draw do\r\n    get \"/\" => \"test#index\"\r\n\r\n    resources :posts do\r\n      resource :comment\r\n    end\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n\r\nrequire \"minitest/autorun\"\r\nrequire \"rack/test\"\r\n\r\nclass BugTest < ActionView::TestCase\r\n  include ActionView::Helpers::FormHelper\r\n  include Rails.application.routes.url_helpers\r\n\r\n  def test_something\r\n    post = Post.create\r\n\r\n    result = form_with model: [post, Comment.new] \r\n    assert result.match %r{\"\\/posts\\/1\\/comment\"}\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  private\r\n\r\n  def app\r\n    Rails.application\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nActionDispatch should return the correct path using a singular child resource `/posts/1/comment`\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\nActionDispatch returns the incorrect path using a plural child resource `/posts/1/comments`\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n**Rails version**: 7.1.3\r\n\r\n**Ruby version**: 3.0.2\r\n",

Several of the attributes of the originating ActiveJob instance get passed into a `set` on that Sidekiq job, but the provider_job_id is not one of them.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n`retry_job` should result in the job having the same `provider_job_id` as it did before the retry.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n'retry_job' results in a change to the `provider_job_id` every time.\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n**Rails version**:\r\n7.1.2\r\n\r\n**Ruby version**:\r\n3.2.2\r\n",

It assumes calling `pool.connection` will memoize the checked out connection and leverage that to start a transaction on it and ensure all subsequent accesses will get the same connection.\r\n\r\nTo allow to remove checkout caching (or make it optional), we first must decouple transactional fixtures to not rely on it.\r\n\r\nThe idea is to behave similarly, but store the connection in the pool as a special \"pinned\" connection, and not as the regular active connection.\r\n\r\nThis allows to always return the same pinned connection, but without necessarily assigning it as the active connection.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this pinning impact all threads and fibers, so that all threads have a consistent view of the database state.\r\n\r\nFYI @matthewd ",

We tried to reproduce it and find when a connection is checked out from the pool, [after some time](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/nat-gateway-troubleshooting.html#nat-gateway-troubleshooting-timeout) when the underlying TCP connection is broken, following query on the connection could trigger the error. On AWS Lambda Function we could steadily reproduce it with all 7.1.x versions. 7.0.8 works well. Can't reproduce it locally. And pool configuration like `idle_timeout`/`reaping_frequency` doesn't change anything.\r\n![img_v3_027q_971706a5-dfe9-4e5b-ac37-114d993fc1dg](https://github.com/rails/rails/assets/3690895/90e09bbf-828b-449d-8e10-8c6c3fcf496b)\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nThe broken connection could be recovered and doesn't affect application.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\nError is raised.\r\n### System configuration\r\n**Rails version**:\r\n7.1\r\n**Ruby version**:\r\n3.2.2",

That means anything logged in `request.action_dispatch` handlers won't have the same tags as the rest of the request.\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nFix this by deferring the popping of tags into `finish_request_instrumentation`, in the same way that finishing the instrumentation handle is deferred.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nThere didn't seem to be any test case related to request log taggers, so I added one. Also, I don't know if this is important enough for a changelog entry, but it seemed harmless enough to add a one-liner in there.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change. Changes that are unrelated should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message. Ex: `[Fix #issue-number]`\r\n* [x] Tests are added or updated if you fix a bug or add a feature.\r\n* [x] CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature. Minor bug fixes and documentation changes should not be included.\r\n",

Changes that are unrelated should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message. Ex: `[Fix #issue-number]`\r\n* [x] Tests are added or updated if you fix a bug or add a feature.\r\n* [x] CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature. Minor bug fixes and documentation changes should not be included.\r\n",

We can do that in our application's initialization path, but connections which have been idle for too long will get cleaned up by the reaper.\r\n\r\nI'd like to add support for specifying a minimum pool size to the connection pools so that we can ensure we always have a certain number of active connections to the DB established.\r\n\r\nAs a starting point, I propose the following changes:\r\n\r\n* [ ] Rename `size` to `max_size` in [`ConnectionPool`](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/ConnectionAdapters/ConnectionPool.html)\r\n* [ ] Alias `size` to `max_size` for backwards compatibility\r\n* [ ] Add `min_size` as a supported option to [`ActiveRecord::DatabaseConfigurations::HashConfig`](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/DatabaseConfigurations/HashConfig.html)\r\n* [ ] Optionally rename `pool` to `max_size` for clarity, and add an alias for `pool` for backwards compat\r\n* [ ] Modify `ConnectionPool` and `ConnectionPool::Reaper` to respect the minimum pool size\r\n\r\nI will add a PR that implements these ideas.",

        "body": "### Motivation / Background\r\n\r\nEnums have historically been defined using keyword arguments:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass Function > ApplicationRecord\r\n  enum color: [:red, :blue],\r\n       type: [:instance, :class],\r\n       _scopes: false\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis has the advantage of being able to define multiple enums at once with the same options. However, it also has a downside that enum options must be prefixed with an underscore to separate them from the enum definitions (to enable models to have enums with the same name as an option).\r\n\r\nIn Rails 7, a new syntax was [introduced][1] to instead define enums with positional arguments:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass Function > ApplicationRecord\r\n  enum :color, [:red, :blue], scopes: false\r\n  enum :type, [:instance, :class], scopes: false\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis new syntax eliminates the need to prefix options with an underscore, and the docs were updated to recommend this new syntax.\r\n\r\nHowever, both versions of the API have been supported since, and it has started to cause some problems:\r\n\r\nThe first issue is that the available options have drifted. In Rails 7.1, an option was added to make assigning an invalid enum value use validation errors instead of runtime errors. However, the equivalent underscored prefix option was not added for the original enum syntax\r\n\r\nArticles have been created that describe the new option in Rails 7.1, but the examples in the articles use un-prefixed options with the old syntax. This confusion has also lead to issues opened asking why that incorrect syntax is not working.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the presence of underscored options is just generally confusing because it tends to imply an option is for internal use.\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nThis commit aims to fix all of these issues by deprecating the old enum syntax. With only one way to define enums, options cannot drift and there will be less confusion around how enums should be defined.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/0618d2d84a501aea93c898aec504ff9a0e09d6f2\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nCloses #50333\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change.

        "body": "### Motivation / Background\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to make Action Cable more flexible and extensible as a library/framework by separating low-level, implementation specific details (e.g., handling WebSockets, dealing with concurrency) from abstractions (Connection, Channel classes). That would make it possible to use user-level Action Cable code with alternative web servers or execution models (e.g., Fibers) without rewriting it or monkey-patching internals.\r\n\r\n> [!TIP]\r\n> You can find a more detailed description of the problem, motivation and potential benefits of such refactoring in [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oGf86NAzQL9sDw6rTfUNSe3mzzg7wX64sc34D-_3EDI/edit#heading=h.d3db1fd03ano).\r\n\r\n> [!NOTE] \r\n> This PR does not introduce any new features or public API breaking changes. It doesn't affect the existing functionality of built-in Action Cable server.\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nThe changes are grouped into commits to reflect the following major changes.\r\n\r\n1) **Reorganizing threaded executors**. \r\n\r\nAction Cable relies on two threaded executors right now: one to perform user-space code (Worker) and another one to perform internal async operations around pub/sub. The latter was for some (historical?) reason hidden within the `StreamEventLoop` class that implements and IO loop to perform read/write operations on sockets. I've extracted the executor and promoted it into a server attribute independent of IO event loop. The main motivation of this extraction is not only in enforcing SoC but to separate WebSocket-specific code from more generic async executor used throughout the codebase.\r\n\r\nI've also wrapped the Concurrent Ruby threaded executor into a custom class with a minimal interface (`#post`, `#timer` and `#shutdown` methods), so it will be possible to configure a custom executor for a server in the future (one use-case we have in mind is using a Fiber-based executor instead of a Thread-based one).\r\n\r\nNote that this PR doesn't include any configuration-related code (e.g., to support smth like `config.action_cable.async_executor = :fiber`) but I'm considering adding something like that in the follow-up PRs.\r\n\r\n2) **Limiting the scope of async operations**.\r\n\r\nThis step is the follow-up to the async executor extraction. We have a few places in the Channel internals which directly refer to the `event_loop` but they're all related to pub/sub operations. So, to avoid unnecessary async operations at the abstraction level, I moved all it to the pub/sub layer by and standardized it across adapters by using a `SubscriberMap::Async` subclass.\r\n\r\nPreviously, we might have double async calls when performing `#stream_from` (one from the channel and one from the pub/sub adapter); now it's up to the adapter whether to create subscriptions asynchronously or not. We shouldn't duplicate this logic.\r\n\r\n3) **Splitting ActionCable::Connection::Base into ActionCable::Connection::Base and ActionCable::Server::Connection**\r\n\r\nToday, the Connection class knows about everything from performing user code to setting up WebSocket event listeners to dealing with Rails executor wrapping. That prevents from reusing this class in environments when we don't need to deal with all of these (non-WebSocket servers or unit tests, more about them below).\r\n\r\nThis change is mostly code reorganization and minor tests updates (e.g., we no longer need to always use `run_in_eventmachine`, because now we deal with pure Ruby classes).\r\n\r\nSo, now we have two types of connections: low-level Server::Connection and application-level Connection::Base. The _communicate_ with each other via the following interfaces:\r\n\r\n```mermaid\r\nclassDiagram\r\n  class _PubSub {\r\n    subscribe: (channel, handler, callback) -> void\r\n    unsubscribe: (channel, handler) -> void\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  class _Executor {\r\n    post: (&block) -> void\r\n    timer: (interval, &block) -> handle\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  class _Server {\r\n    pubsub: _PubSub\r\n    executor: _Executor\r\n    config: Configuration \r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  class _ServerConn {\r\n    logger: Logger\r\n    env: Hash[String, untyped]\r\n    request: Request\r\n    protocol: String\r\n    initialize: (_Server, env) -> void\r\n    transmit: (untyped) -> void\r\n    close: () -> void\r\n    perform_work: (untyped receiver, method_name Symbol, *untyped args) -> void\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  class _Connection {\r\n    initialize: (_Server, _ServerConn) -> void\r\n    handle_open: () -> void\r\n    handle_incoming: (payload) -> void\r\n    handle_close: () -> void\r\n    beat: () -> void\r\n    statistics: () -> Hash[Symbol, untyped]\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  _Server --> _PubSub\r\n  _Server --> _Executor\r\n  _Connection --> _ServerConn\r\n  _Connection --> _Server\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Examples / follow-ups\r\n\r\n#### Action Cable testing\r\n\r\nHere is an example commit (one of the future PRs) demonstrating how this refactoring simplifies Action Cable testing and make it more robust (no patches, real connection and channel classes, etc.): https://github.com/palkan/rails/commit/3ba6d35c788134faeb062b12f371aab5da1886b8\r\n\r\n#### Action Cable over SSE\r\n\r\nHere is a sketch of how SSE transport for Action Cable can be implemented (based on the changes from this PR): https://gist.github.com/palkan/270a192e79b05d5601fe497ad3ec83b5\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nHere is a [Discord thread](https://discord.com/channels/849034466856665118/1168026423001366609) where we discuss the project.\r\n\r\nThere is an old PR attempting to achieve the same goal: https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/27648.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change. Changes that are unrelated should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message. Ex: `[Fix #issue-number]`\r\n* [x] Tests are added or updated if you fix a bug or add a feature.\r\n* [ ] CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature. Minor bug fixes and documentation changes should not be included.\r\n\r\n/cc @ioquatix @matthewd @rafaelfranca ",

This setup works well for local development but becomes cumbersome when developers use Dockerized PostgreSQL instances or switch between local and Docker environments. \r\n\r\n```bash\r\n> rails db:prepare\r\nbin/rails aborted!\r\nActiveRecord::ConnectionNotEstablished: connection to server on socket \"/tmp/.s.PGSQL.5432\" failed: No such file or directory (ActiveRecord::ConnectionNotEstablished)\r\n\tIs the server running locally and accepting connections on that socket?\r\n\r\nCaused by:\r\nPG::ConnectionBad: connection to server on socket \"/tmp/.s.PGSQL.5432\" failed: No such file or directory (PG::ConnectionBad)\r\n\tIs the server running locally and accepting connections on that socket?\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy facilitating easy switching between these environments without the need to manually edit the `database.yml` file, this PR aims to streamline the development workflow, making it more efficient and less error-prone.\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nThis Pull Request changes the PostgreSQL database configuration template (`postgresql.yml.tt`) by introducing dynamic environment variable support for the `host`, `username`, and, `password` settings in the default configuration. Specifically, it allows these settings to be overridden via environment variables, with defaults provided for local development. This approach enables developers to easily switch between a local PostgreSQL server and a Dockerized PostgreSQL instance by simply setting or unsetting environment variables, without the need for manual configuration file edits.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nThis approach supports the idea in https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/50914#discussion_r1478343297.\r\n\r\n~~I do not like to use `\"<%= app_name.upcase %>_...\" in variable names, but I followed the naming in https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/2c5fe6fa7aba4a10d56ff4ee54d26511e58dda3b/railties/lib/rails/generators/rails/app/templates/config/databases/postgresql.yml.tt#L84.~~\r\n\r\n~~As suggested in https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/50914#discussion_r1478855943, I would rather use `DATABASE_URL`, `POSTGRES_USER`, and `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`.~~\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change. Changes that are unrelated should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message. Ex: `[Fix #issue-number]`\r\n* [ ] Tests are added or updated if you fix a bug or add a feature.\r\n* [ ] CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature. Minor bug fixes and documentation changes should not be included.\r\n\r\nI am not able to run the tests in Dev Container or locally on macOS (it crashes 👎🏼).  Of course, I would love to add or fix tests, need more tome to set up the local environment.\r\n\r\nBut I could create a new app from local branch, which includes correct generated Postgres database config (https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/contributing_to_ruby_on_rails.html#running-an-application-against-your-local-branch).",

Opening an issue for visibility and to allow community to disagree whether the behavior is intended or not.\r\n\r\n### Context\r\n\r\nCalling `.dup` on an Active Record instance causes all attributes to be marked as \"came from user\" despite of their original state. \r\nThis seems like a bug as it leads to completely untouched attributes to return `true` from `came_from_user? calls. \r\nThe only small concern I have is that the `*_came_from_user?` methods don't seem to be publicly documented. However I assume they intend to become public and also Rails itself relies on the method to work correctly so it should be worth fixing\r\n\r\n### Reproduction script:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n# frozen_string_literal: true\r\n\r\nrequire \"bundler/inline\"\r\n\r\ngemfile(true) do\r\n  source \"https://rubygems.org\"\r\n\r\n  git_source(:github) { |repo| \"https://github.com/#{repo}.git\" }\r\n\r\n  gem \"rails\"\r\n\r\n  gem \"sqlite3\"\r\n  gem \"debug\"\r\nend\r\n\r\nrequire \"debug\"\r\nrequire \"active_record\"\r\nrequire \"minitest/autorun\"\r\nrequire \"logger\"\r\n\r\n# This connection will do for database-independent bug reports.\r\nActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection(adapter: \"sqlite3\", database: \":memory:\")\r\nActiveRecord::Base.logger = Logger.new(STDOUT)\r\n\r\nActiveRecord::Schema.define do\r\n  create_table :people, force: true do |t|\r\n    t.string :name\r\n    t.integer :age\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n\r\nclass Person < ActiveRecord::Base\r\nend\r\n\r\nclass BugTest < Minitest::Test\r\n  def test_dup_does_not_change_attribute_value_type\r\n    person = Person.new(name: \"Nikita\")\r\n\r\n    assert_predicate person, :name_came_from_user?\r\n    refute_predicate person, :age_came_from_user?\r\n\r\n    person_dup = person.dup\r\n\r\n    assert_predicate person_dup, :name_came_from_user?\r\n    refute_predicate person_dup, :age_came_from_user?\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  def test_clone_does_not_change_attribute_value_type\r\n    person = Person.new(name: \"Nikita\")\r\n\r\n    assert_predicate person, :name_came_from_user?\r\n    refute_predicate person, :age_came_from_user?\r\n\r\n    person_copy = person.clone\r\n\r\n    assert_predicate person_copy, :name_came_from_user?\r\n    refute_predicate person_copy, :age_came_from_user?\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nFailure:\r\n```\r\nFailure:\r\nBugTest#test_dup_does_not_change_attribute_value_type:\r\nExpected #<Person id: nil, name: \"Nikita\", age: nil> to not be age_came_from_user?.\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: `clone` example works as is, I'm adding it just to ensure that the fix doesn't suddenly break `clone` behavior.",

It was costly to use it before in the gem, but we made it fast (https://github.com/basecamp/marginalia/pull/138), so it is not *that* costly and people deliberately decide if they want to use it.\r\n\r\nI would like to have the `:line` option (upd: decided to name it as `:source_location`), it is very much useful. Without it, if we have a slow db query log, for example, it is very hard to know from which part of the codebase the query was generated. Even having an `:action` component, you need to investigate the unfamiliar codebase to find out where the query was triggered.\r\n\r\ncc @byroot ",

My theory is that it has something to do with changing `response.parsed_body` to return a HWIA (in #49003).\r\n\r\nThis change is different from the 7-1-stable PR in that it removes the need to stringify or symbolize any keys, since we are comparing the metadata with string keys. This is a follow up to #43705.\r\n\r\nThis PR came out of the work in #50427, but since I was able to reproduce these failures on main, I wanted to fix them first.",

If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message. Ex: `[Fix #issue-number]`\r\n* [ ] Tests are added or updated if you fix a bug or add a feature.\r\n* [ ] CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature. Minor bug fixes and documentation changes should not be included.\r\n",

I wrote a basic guide and incorporated a lot of feedback from @byroot (Jean Boussier), who wrote the thread count PR.\r\n\r\nThis pull request adds the suggested Rails Guide.\r\n\r\nCC @nateberkopec - though I know you're very busy right now :-)\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nIt's impossible to have a detailed guide for all possible Rails deployment options. This guide focuses on Puma (the default server) and CRuby, and on giving a good start to people who don't already know deployment well. I've tried to mention core performance issues without explaining every possible configuration change.\r\n\r\nNext time there is a deployment configuration change, there will be a place to document the tradeoffs.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [X] This Pull Request is related to one change. Changes that are unrelated should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [X] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why.

However if the association is bi-directional, destroying only works from one end – and the end which succeeds depends on the order of `belongs_to` declarations in the join model.  I believe it should work from both ends.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n# frozen_string_literal: true\r\n\r\nrequire \"bundler/inline\"\r\n\r\ngemfile(true) do\r\n  source \"https://rubygems.org\"\r\n\r\n  git_source(:github) { |repo| \"https://github.com/#{repo}.git\" }\r\n\r\n  gem \"rails\"\r\n  gem \"sqlite3\"\r\nend\r\n\r\nrequire \"active_record\"\r\nrequire \"minitest/autorun\"\r\nrequire \"logger\"\r\n\r\nActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection(adapter: \"sqlite3\", database: \":memory:\")\r\nActiveRecord::Base.logger = Logger.new(STDOUT)\r\n\r\nActiveRecord::Schema.define do\r\n  create_table :lefts, force: true do |t|\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  create_table :rights, force: true do |t|\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  create_table :middles, force: true do |t|\r\n    t.references :left, foreign_key: true\r\n    t.references :right, foreign_key: true\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n\r\nclass Left < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n  has_one :middle, dependent: :destroy\r\n  has_one :right, through: :middle\r\nend\r\n\r\nclass Middle < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n  belongs_to :left, dependent: :destroy\r\n  belongs_to :right, dependent: :destroy\r\nend\r\n\r\nclass Right < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n  has_one :middle, dependent: :destroy\r\n  has_one :left, through: :middle\r\nend\r\n\r\nclass BugTest < Minitest::Test\r\n  def test_destroying_left_destroys_right\r\n    left = Left.create!\r\n    right = Right.create!\r\n    middle = Middle.create! left: left, right: right\r\n\r\n    left.destroy\r\n    assert right.destroyed?\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  def test_destroying_right_destroys_left\r\n    left = Left.create!\r\n    right = Right.create!\r\n    middle = Middle.create! left: left, right: right\r\n\r\n    right.destroy\r\n    assert left.destroyed?\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nI expect:\r\n\r\n- `left.destroy` to also destroy its `middle` and its `right`\r\n- `right.destroy` to also destroy its `middle` and its `left`\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\n- `right.destroy` destroys its `middle` and its `left`\r\n-  `left.destroy` destroys its `middle` but does not destroy its `right`\r\n\r\nHowever if I reverse the order of `Middle`'s `belongs_to` declarations, `right.destroy` stops working and `left.destroy` starts working.\r\n\r\n### Patch\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes the behaviour and does not break any existing tests (via `bundle exec rake test:sqlite3`):\r\n\r\n```diff\r\ndiff --git i/activerecord/lib/active_record/callbacks.rb w/activerecord/lib/active_record/callbacks.rb\r\nindex 29c72d1024..6e9c68b747 100644\r\n--- i/activerecord/lib/active_record/callbacks.rb\r\n+++ w/activerecord/lib/active_record/callbacks.rb\r\n@@ -418,7 +418,7 @@ module ClassMethods\r\n \r\n     def destroy # :nodoc:\r\n       @_destroy_callback_already_called ||= false\r\n-      return if @_destroy_callback_already_called\r\n+      return true if @_destroy_callback_already_called\r\n       @_destroy_callback_already_called = true\r\n       _run_destroy_callbacks { super }\r\n     rescue RecordNotDestroyed => e\r\n```\r\n\r\nCredit for the patch belongs to [Alex](https://stackoverflow.com/a/77917179/151007).\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\n**Rails version**: 7.1.3\r\n\r\n**Ruby version**: 3.3.0\r\n",

However, the RubyTracker does include the ability to evaluate explicit \"Template Dependency\" comments with wildcard nodes.\r\n\r\nThis commit extends the RipperRenderParser and PrismRenderParser to convert interpolated strings into wildcard globs. Additionally, it changes the RubyTracker to evaluate wildcards the same for both implicit and explicit dependencies. This enables the RubyTracker to identify potential dependencies for interpolated renders, which it was previously unable to do.\r\n\r\ncc @jhawthorn if you think this is a good idea I can try to apply it to ActionView::Precompiler as well\r\n",

        "body": "### Motivation / Background\r\n\r\nThis Pull Request has been created because I want to make it easier to retry actionable errors that occur when running tests. Rails already knows how to recover these errors, so lets make it possible for the user to recover from them and run their tests without exiting the process.\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nAllow Actionable Errors encountered when running tests to be retried. This can be configured by `config.actionable_command_line_errors` and is `true` in the test environment unless the `\"CI\"` env variable is set, and false otherwise.\r\n\r\n    \r\n    Migrations are pending. To resolve this issue, run:\r\n    \r\n            bin/rails db:migrate\r\n    \r\n    You have 1 pending migration:\r\n    \r\n    db/migrate/20240201213806_add_a_to_b.rb\r\n    Run pending migrations? [Yn] Y\r\n    == 20240201213806 AddAToB: migrating =========================================\r\n    == 20240201213806 AddAToB: migrated (0.0000s) ================================\r\n    \r\n    Running 7 tests in a single process (parallelization threshold is 50)\r\n    Run options: --seed 22200\r\n    \r\n    # Running:\r\n    \r\n    .......\r\n    \r\n    Finished in 0.243394s, 28.7600 runs/s, 45.1942 assertions/s.\r\n    7 runs, 11 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips\r\n    \r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nRight now this is only implemented in the Test Runner, but I'd also like to follow up with a similar implementation for `Rails::Command::CorrectableNameError`s.\r\n\r\nAlso we could introduce a new framework default for the configuration if this is the direction in this PR is acceptable.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change. Changes that are unrelated should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message. Ex: `[Fix #issue-number]`\r\n* [x] Tests are added or updated if you fix a bug or add a feature.\r\n* [x] CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature. Minor bug fixes and documentation changes should not be included.\r\n",

        "body": "This fixes race condition in Active Storage when multiple preprocessed variants are defined for a `Previewable` file is attached.\r\n\r\n## Background\r\n\r\nWhen a variant is specified for a \"previewable\" file type (e.g. video  or PDF) attachment, a `preview_image` attachment is first created and attached on the original blob and then any user-specified variants are derived from _that_ preview image. When those variants are named and have `preprocessed: true`, the jobs to create those variants are queued simultaneously.\r\n\r\nExample from my case:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n  has_one_attached :file, dependent: :purge_later do |attachable|\r\n    attachable.variant :preview, resize_to_fill: [400, 400], preprocessed: true\r\n    attachable.variant :still, format: \"jpg\", saver: {quality: 85}, preprocessed: true\r\n  end\r\n```\r\n\r\n## The issue\r\n\r\nWhen a `Previewable` attachment is created (a video, in my case), `TransformJob.perform_later` is called for each named variant with `preprocessed: true`. Unless your queue adapter is synchronous (e.g. :inline or :test), this results in a race condition in which every such variant's worker will check `processed?`, see that no `preview_image` attachment exists yet on the `ActiveStorage::Blob`, and:\r\n\r\n1. Redundantly download the file from storage\r\n2. Create duplicative ActiveStorage::Attachment and `ActiveStorage::Blob` records for the `preview_image` attachment (all but one of which will be orphaned from the original blob's `has_one_attached :preview_image`)\r\n3. Create variant blobs (and associated `ActiveStorage::VariantRecord`) that are similarly orphaned (by virtue of being a variant of an orphaned `preview_image` blob)\r\n\r\nAs a result, if the video is ever purged, `PurgeJob` will only find the current `has_one_attached :preview_image` and whatever variant demanded it into existence, then leave the rest as orphaned records in the database and in storage.\r\n\r\n## The fix\r\n\r\nPretty simple: wrap the first step of the job in `blob.with_lock {}`. By pessimistically locking on the blob, we can prevent processing the preview image multiple times by multiple `TransformJob` jobs running concurrently.\r\n\r\nAlternate approaches would all be more work:\r\n\r\n* Queuing a `PreviewImage` job instead of N `TransformJob` and have it, only after `preview_image` is attached, enqueue those `TransformJob` jobs\r\n* Batching up all the named variant transformations into a single meta-job\r\n\r\n## Testing caveat \r\n\r\nWriting a test for this inside Rails would be difficult because it would require running the resulting TransformJob jobs concurrently. I [started a test](https://github.com/searls/rails/blob/fix-video-duplicate-preview-variants/activestorage/test/models/variant_with_record_test.rb#L348-L367) but failed to reproduce, in part because the test queue adapter will perform enqueued jobs inline instead of concurrently. In order to write a test that replicated the issue appropriately, we might first need a new option for `perform_enqueued_jobs(async: true) { … }`\r\n\r\nIf you're interested, [this gist](https://gist.github.com/searls/5b8298abe88b3206f670ea3c6d574aab) includes a driver script and output before and after the patch showing it working.\r\n\r\n## Evaluating impact on existing Active Storage users\r\n\r\nI only found this because I'm a total cheapskate and was literally counting records in my S3 bucket to ensure `PurgeJob` worked. Then I wasted the next two days trying to figure out why before landing on this. I strongly suspect that ActiveStorage users who host video and take advantage of `preprocessed: true` named variants will have a lot of orphaned stuff floating around their buckets.\r\n\r\nTo see if you have any such \"zombie\" preview_images (and presumably, associated variants) floating around your application that would survive calls to `purge` on the owning attachment, you could write a query like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nActiveStorage::Attachment\r\n  .joins(\"INNER JOIN active_storage_attachments as other_attachments ON\r\n          active_storage_attachments.record_id = other_attachments.record_id AND\r\n          active_storage_attachments.id != other_attachments.id\")\r\n  .where(\r\n    :name => \"preview_image\",\r\n    :record_type => \"ActiveStorage::Blob\",\r\n    \"other_attachments.name\" => \"preview_image\",\r\n    \"other_attachments.record_type\" => \"ActiveStorage::Blob\"\r\n  )\r\n  .distinct\r\n```\r\n\r\nClearing out one's production database and backend storage to get this all right-sized should be a fun exercise for the reader.",

For my app fragments kept coming up blank, and the writing was not being triggered.  So in a sense it was stuck.  This will ensure that an option passed down called blanks_ok, (blanks_ok: true/false), will make it so that if the cache returns and empty string, we will trigger a write over or it will return the empty string if it is set to true. (the default value is false, must explicitly pass true to get blank strings back)\r\n\r\nThis Pull Request has been created because my app had to way of escaping blank strings being returned from the cache.\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nThis Pull Request changes the way that caching writes are triggered.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nFor my app I simply monkey patched the action view helper, but I would like to move away from that and try to contribute bug fixes I found useful.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change.

If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message. Ex: `[Fix #issue-number]`\r\n* [ ] Tests are added or updated if you fix a bug or add a feature.\r\n* [ ] CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature. Minor bug fixes and documentation changes should not be included.\r\n",

        "body": "After upgrading from 7.0.8 to 7.1.3, images that had been uploaded via ActionText all started 404ing.\r\n\r\nInitially I thought this was due to the [digest changing from SHA1 to SHA256 when Turbo-Rails went to 1.1.1](https://github.com/hotwired/turbo-rails/blob/main/UPGRADING.md#key-digest-changes-in-111) (see also https://github.com/hotwired/turbo-rails/issues/340) – but that was a red herring.  In fact my Turbo-Rails was already past 1.1.1 when I upgraded Rails to 7.1.3.\r\n\r\nEventually I realised the breakage was in fact due to the [`secret_key_base` moving for local environments](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/48470).\r\n\r\n> In the local environment, both the development and test `secret_key_base` value will be fetched from `tmp/development_secret.txt` (before Rails 7.1) or `tmp/local_secret.txt` (from Rails 7.1). This file will have the value which will be used as `secret_key_base`.\r\n\r\n– [Rails 7.1 Store secret_key_base In Credentials For Local Environment](https://blog.saeloun.com/2023/08/11/rails-7-1-store-secret-key-base-in-rails-config/)\r\n\r\nAnd of course for me the two files differed.\r\n\r\nSo the solution is `mv tmp/development_secret.txt tmp/local_secret.txt` in development.\r\n\r\nFortunately production is unaffected because Rails looks elsewhere for the `secret_key_base` value and this did not change.\r\n\r\nI'm posting this here in the hope that it helps anybody else who runs into the same problem.",

This means that the the encryption layer is not transparent to binary data - which should be passed as Type::Binary::Data.\r\n\r\nAs a result the data is not properly escaped in the SQL queries or deserialized correctly after decryption.\r\n\r\nHowever it just happens to work fine for MySQL and SQLite because the MessageSerializer doesn't use any characters that need to be encoded. However if you try to use a custom serializer that does then it breaks.\r\n\r\nPostgreSQL on the other hand does not work - because the Bytea type is passed a String rather than a Type::Binary::Data to deserialize, it attempts to unescape the data and either mangles it or raises an error if it contains null bytes.\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nThe commit fixes the issue, by reserializing the data after encryption and decryption. For text data that's a no-op, but for binary data we'll convert it back to a Type::Binary::Data.\r\n",

This is confusing and has a major side effect that if a user defines an `assertion` in that teardown code, it will raise out without getting rescued (see the [calling code](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/main/activesupport/lib/active_support/testing/setup_and_teardown.rb#L47)). This means `super` will never get called, `ActiveRecord::TestFixtures.teardown_fixtures` will never run, and the database state will not get rolled back.\r\n\r\nBy moving the `teardown` callbacks to run in the `teardown` lifecycle, all `after_teardown` code will run since the error will get rescued by Minitest's lifecycle management:\r\n* [Lifecycle hooks](https://github.com/minitest/minitest/blob/master/lib/minitest/test.rb#L98-L100)\r\n* [capture_exceptions](https://github.com/minitest/minitest/blob/master/lib/minitest/test.rb#L194)\r\n\r\nMinitest also provides recommendations about when to use `after_teardown` and `before_setup`:\r\nhttps://docs.seattlerb.org/minitest/Minitest/Test/LifecycleHooks.html\r\n\r\n> after_teardown()\r\n> Runs after every test, after teardown. This hook is meant for libraries to extend minitest. It is not meant to be used by test developers.\r\n\r\nThere is a slight grey area here, where the `setup` and `teardown` callbacks are code written and provided by the \"test developers\". It was surprising at least to me to find that they were not run in `setup` and `teardown` Minitest Lifecycle hooks but rather `before_setup` and `after_teardown`.\r\n\r\nMoving the callbacks to run in their respective Minitest Lifecycle hooks properly will follow Minitest's recommendations and clear up any confusion about where these callbacks are run.\r\n\r\n#### `ActiveRecord::TestFixture.after_teardown`\r\n* Wrap `teardown_fixtures` in `ensure` block to always run the code that rolls back the test's database transactions.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change. Changes that are unrelated should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message. Ex: `[Fix #issue-number]`\r\n* [x] Tests are added or updated if you fix a bug or add a feature.\r\n* [x] CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature. Minor bug fixes and documentation changes should not be included.\r\n",

Instead we will just `REDIS_URL` and `DB_HOST`.\r\n\r\nFor system tests, we need to configure the `Capybara` host and port to the selenium container. Rather than expose the implementation details of `Capybara` to the developer, we created a new `served_by` method on `SystemTestCase` to configure these.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change.

information\r\n\r\n`httpclient` gem that includes  https://github.com/nahi/httpclient/pull/455  has not been released to rubygems.org yet. In the meantime I want to make \"Daily build with Ruby head\" green. Once the newer versions of http client is released this commit can be reverted.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change. Changes that are unrelated should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why.

RateLimiting relies on a feature of the underlying store. This feature needs to be documented, so that it remains supported, and so alternative stores know to support it.\r\n\r\nThis PR has been created to document this behavior.\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nThe feature is that `increment`, when passed `expires_in`, will set expiration time when the key is first created, and ignore that option if the key already exists.\r\n\r\nThat functionality is already tested [here](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/cf26c5482924babca573e6c01594d77e3321ae58/activesupport/test/cache/behaviors/cache_increment_decrement_behavior.rb#L34), in the `CacheIncrementDecrementBehavior` test module.\r\n\r\nThis Pull Request changes the documentation of `ActiveSupport::Cache::Store.increment` to reflect a now-required feature of existing stores.",

        "body": "Previously, the skeleton test would assert that every file in the `default_files` list existed. However, since there is no requirement that a file is added to this list when added to the generator the list can (and has) become out of sync with the exact generated output.\r\n\r\nThis commit refactors the skeleton test to gather the full list of files created by the generator so that it can be compared exactly to the list of `default_files`. This ensures the generated file list must be updated when any file is added or removed from the generator. Additionally, by using array equality the sorting of the `default_files` list is enforced (it was previously _mostly_ alphabetical, but not fully).\r\n\r\nThe new skeleton test assertion was written to only assert files instead of folders for a few reasons:\r\n- asserting that folders exist is redundant if a file exists within a folder (and the `default_files` list would be significantly longer with all folders)\r\n- any folder generated without any files inside it will not be tracked by Git, so other code cannot assume these empty folders exist\r\n\r\nBecause of these reasons, this patch also includes a change to no longer generate the `tmp/cache/assets` folder by default. The folder is an implementation detail of Sprockets and doesn't need any special treatment in Rails. The `Sprockets::Cache::FileStore` will create the directory if it does not exist (which it usually won't since `tmp/cache` is excluded from Git by the `.gitignore`), and the `tmp:cache:clear` task already clears all subdirectories of `tmp/cache`.\r\n\r\nFinally, some tests making assertions about the default output of the app generator were removed as they have been made redundant by the improvements to the skeleton test.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n[Assert exact file output for plugins too](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/50903/commits/c278684ae180302b073c8190d2fb50f3a359528c)\r\n\r\nIn a [previous commit][1], the App Generator skeleton test was updated to verify the exact file output when generating a new application. This commit applies the same change to the Plugin Generator.\r\n\r\nAt first, I was hesitant to add the list of dummy app files to the `default_files` for the Plugin Generator test, however it quickly became apparent that it was a good idea. Making this change exposed that recent file additions to the App Generator were added to the plugin's dummy app as well. Things like CI files, rubocop configuration, and a brakeman command should not be created for a dummy app, and are now properly excluded.\r\n\r\nSimilar to the App Generator commit, this change also removes tests that are now redundant due to the skeleton test verifying the exact list of files generated.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/e5e4b801046bceb1067ffb316edd1ad704b6596d\r\n",

That is, just reference them.\r\n\r\nIf we document that you can toggle this in the autoloading guide, we should follow with something like: \"this would make sense for example if...\", and I don't see a use case. The upgrading guide is right. You're not supposed to issue `require` calls for stuff in the autoload paths, therefore there should be no API for that.\r\n\r\nSo, I would just remove these docs. If someone finds this in their code base, the configuration guide documents it.\r\n\r\nI'd also backport this to `7-1-stable`, whose autoloading guide [is incorrect right now](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/20c58a4ea2e721cea9548cc9bbf720e882b1619d/guides/source/autoloading_and_reloading_constants.md#load_pathload_path) (it says this is `true` by default).\r\n\r\n@byroot what do you think? Could we even perhaps consider this flag to be a transition aid that could be deprecated and later deleted?\r\n\r\n/cc @siaw23 ",

This can be useful in case of multiple production environments or staging environments that also use the `production` rails env.\r\n\r\n`RAILS_PROMPT_COLOR` can be used to override the colour. This can be usefully to differentiate between a real production environment and a staging / QA environment that runs in `production` mode.\r\n\r\n### Motivation / Background\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nDescribe why this Pull Request needs to be merged. What bug have you fixed? What feature have you added? Why is it important?\r\nIf you are fixing a specific issue, include \"Fixes #ISSUE\" (replace with the issue number, remove the quotes) and the issue will be linked to this PR.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis Pull Request has been created because we often work with different \"production\" like environments.\r\neg they all use the same settings in `production`; but are for different cases. Eg one could be a staging environment, or even multiple production environments eg different installations for different tenants.\r\nIn this case we still want to color the environment (eg red for all actual production environments, but cyan for staging environments) + correctly name them.\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nThis Pull Request changes https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/50796\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nI took the liberty to change the last ChangeLog entry (and add my name) instead of creating a new changelog entry, as the changes relate to the latest change anyway.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change. Changes that are unrelated should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message. Ex: `[Fix #issue-number]`\r\n* [x] Tests are added or updated if you fix a bug or add a feature.\r\n* [x] CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature. Minor bug fixes and documentation changes should not be included.\r\n",

        "body": "### Motivation / Background\r\n\r\n#### My Specific Use Case\r\n\r\nIn my project, where `ActiveStorage.track_variants = true`, I needed to generate a variant of an image (a thumbnail for a room on a floorplan) but did not want to create a variant record of the original image record. This is because I intended to save the variant on a child relation, separate from the original image record.\r\n\r\n#### The Challenge\r\nWith `ActiveStorage.track_variants = true` every variant generated through `ActiveStorage` is automatically tracked in the database to the original record. There are cases in this application where we **do** want to track these variant records so I was unable to change the default configuration. This meant to properly generate my variant I had to use `ImageProcessing::Vips` directly to not generate the variant record. This worked but generated two concerns for me:\r\n\r\n1. This specific code is dependent on `ImageProcessing::Vips` and if we were to ever migrate to another image processor we would have to remember to update this code as well instead of just relying on the `ActiveStorage` default processor.\r\n2. It strays enough from the standard pattern when generating `ActiveStorage` variants that without good documentation it can become confusing to maintain.\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nThis pull request adds the `track` option to the `variant` method which allows for overriding of the `ActiveStorage.track_variants`. This is useful when in cases where you want to stray from the application's standard configuration.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nActiveSupport.track_variants\r\n# => true\r\nuser.avatar.variant(track: false, resize_to_limit: [100, 100])\r\n# => #<ActiveStorage::Variant:0x00007f4e0004ffb0> \r\n```\r\nand\r\n```ruby\r\nActiveSupport.track_variants\r\n# => false\r\nuser.avatar.variant(track: true, resize_to_limit: [100, 100])\r\n# => #<ActiveStorage::VariantWithRecord:0x00007f4e0004ffb0> \r\n```\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nThis is my first time contributing to Rails and I appreciate anyone who takes the time to read all this. I tried my best to follow all conventions and to keep all current functionality, but in the case that I missed something I'd be happy to discuss and fix whatever is needed.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change. Changes that are unrelated should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message. Ex: `[Fix #issue-number]`\r\n* [x] Tests are added or updated if you fix a bug or add a feature.\r\n* [x] CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature. Minor bug fixes and documentation changes should not be included.\r\n",

What bug have you fixed? What feature have you added? Why is it important?\r\nIf you are fixing a specific issue, include \"Fixes #ISSUE\" (replace with the issue number, remove the quotes) and the issue will be linked to this PR.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThere may be instances where a developer is working in an environment where a higher cost than the default (12) for BCrypt is required either due to arbitrary security requirements or the recommended minimum changes and the version of bcrypt used isn't updated.\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nThis change adds a `cost:` argument to `has_secure_password`. If provided, it will use that value for the password cost. Its value is validated to make sure it's between `BCrypt::Engine::MIN_COST` and `BCrypt::Engine::MAX_COST`.\r\n\r\nAdditionally `[password attribute]_cost` is exposed as a convenience method to determine the cost used for the set password hash. This can be used to review the current costs from a user record and either transparently upgrade the user's password or force a password reset.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nI'm not 100% married to using `cost` as the argument name as it affects only new passwords created for the record going forward.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change.

When I tried to destroy a record, it raised an error that I needed a queue adapter. There is a dependency between the has_one_attached method and a queue adapter. \r\n\r\nThat is why adding more context about the functionality and requirements about using the has_one_attached method is important. \r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [X] This Pull Request is related to one change. Changes that are unrelated should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [X] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message. Ex: `[Fix #issue-number]`\r\n* [ ] Tests are added or updated if you fix a bug or add a feature.\r\n* [X] CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature. Minor bug fixes and documentation changes should not be included.\r\n",

As far as I can tell that's the only `IOError` trilogy can raise, so this commit rescues the trilogy-specific error instead.\r\n* As far as I can tell Trilogy does not raise `SocketError`, so don't bother translating that\r\n* Don't treat `TRILOGY_UNEXPECTED_PACKET` as a connection error. If we get this, it's probably a bug in trilogy that we should fix. I'd like to eventually get rid of `TRILOGY_INVALID_SEQUENCE_ID` too, but we're currently relying on it in a few tests (related to trilogy missing caching_sha2_password auth support, if I recall correctly)\r\n\r\nI'm kinda hoping we'll eventually be able to simplify this to something like:\r\n\r\n```rb\r\nif exception.is_a?(Trilogy::ConnectionError)\r\n  ConnectionFailed.new(message, connection_pool: @pool)\r\nelse\r\n  super\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut we'd need more changes to trilogy before that is possible.",

While the [minitest-hooks](https://github.com/jeremyevans/minitest-hooks) gem provides support for `around`, Active Support's callback system makes adding `around` hooks fairly trivial, and is guaranteed to be implemented in the same way as all other callbacks (Controller, Jobs, Mailers, etc.).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nAdd a callback, which runs around `TestCase#setup`, the `test` block, and `TestCase#teardown`.

        "body": "### Motivation / Background\r\n\r\nIn Intercom we are working on detecting queries with large result sets, as Vitess based databases (like in our case Planetscale) block queries that return more than (by default) 100k result set rows.\r\n\r\nWe have an internal patch for this that works well for us, but thought to contribute this upstream, so others can benefit\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nThis Pull Request changes `{*}Adapter.log`, which emits `sql.active_record` notifications.\r\n\r\nPreviously the instrument call only logs information that goes into a request, but allows the caller inside the block to modify the payload. We make use of this inside each adapter to add a new field to each `sql.active_record` notification with the number of result rows being returned in each query.\r\n\r\nThis allows consumers of this notification [(example)](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-rb/blob/master/lib/datadog/tracing/contrib/active_record/events/sql.rb) to consume this metric. \r\n\r\nThere is previous work in this regard with the [`RecordFetchWarning`](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/main/activerecord/lib/active_record/relation/record_fetch_warning.rb) module that can be included, which demonstrates the need to monitor queries with large result sets. In our case these log lines weren't easy to integrate into our observability stack, and having a numerical value attached to each sql trace allowed us to use the full power of our observability suite. \r\n\r\nThis pr also includes three tests in the instrumentation test suite that verify this working for model instanciation queries, direct value queries like `pluck` and raw `ActiveRecord::Base.connection.execute(sql)` queries.\r\n\r\n### Performance\r\n\r\nThe change asks the resultset how many elements it has. Expectation was that that should be a constant lookup, and benchmarks suggest this to be true:\r\n\r\nI have tested this change with `examples/performance` on adapters `sqlite3`, `mysql2` and `postgresql` with no measurable difference in performance (less than 0.1% when standard deviation was 1%).\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nI originally approached this inside `abstract_adapter` but it turns out every adapters Result uses a different method, so I moved the call into each adapters respective usage of `log` \r\n\r\n[`RecordFetchWarning`](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/main/activerecord/lib/active_record/relation/record_fetch_warning.rb) works by patching `exec_queries`, so it aggregates the result set size of multiple queries into one, which is less helpful for this case, as the limits imposed by Vitess are per query. Additionally, this does not support the case of executing raw SQL on the connection, which is something that this patch captures.\r\n\r\nAs for the field name on the payload `row_count` seemed like a good name as it follows the same pattern as `result_count` does in https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_support_instrumentation.html#instantiation-active-record\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change. Changes that are unrelated should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message.

What bug have you fixed? What feature have you added? Why is it important?\r\nIf you are fixing a specific issue, include \"Fixes #ISSUE\" (replace with the issue number, remove the quotes) and the issue will be linked to this PR.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/50812\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nThis Pull Request changes `#merge_select_values`, `#merge_joins` and `#merge_outer_joins` in `ActiveRecord::Relation::Merger` to unionise selects, inner and outer joins when the two sources of a `merge` are related via STI.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n<!-- Provide additional information such as benchmarks, reference to other repositories or alternative solutions. -->\r\n\r\nThe only similar case left in `ActiveRecord::Relation::Merger` is when [merging preloads](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/68eade83c87ae309191add6dfa4959d7d7e07464/activerecord/lib/active_record/relation/merger.rb#L101).\r\n\r\nI don't think that is similar to these cases since the preload values are simply used to preload associations. I thought I would just mention it anyway.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change. Changes that are unrelated should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message. Ex: `[Fix #issue-number]`\r\n* [x] Tests are added or updated if you fix a bug or add a feature.\r\n* [x] CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature. Minor bug fixes and documentation changes should not be included.\r\n",

When set to `false`, the encryptor will never compress the data.\r\n\r\nThis can be used with the `encryptor` option in the model:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass Record < ApplicationRecord\r\n  encrypts :field, encryptor: ActiveRecord::Encryption::Encryptor.new(compress: false)\r\nend\r\n```\r\n",

This allow to stop adding constants such as `RUBY_RESERVED_KEYWORDS` into `Module`.\r\n- `Module#delegate` no longer accept the private and undocumented `as:` parameter. It's for internal use only. Internal users are converted to call `ActiveSupport::Delegation.generate`\r\n- Generate more optimized code for the very common `delegate ..., to: :class`.\r\n- Allow internal users to provide the method signature directly.\r\n\r\nIdeally `Module::DelegationError` should be deprecated, but I'm kinda worried about defining `Module#const_missing` to do that, I fear it might have unintended consequences. But there is little reason why someone would rescue `DelegationError`, so perhaps we can just remove it without a deprecation cycle. For now I left it as a `:nodoc:` alias.",

However, its logic even filters out the main page, namely `railties/RDOC_MAIN.md`, which I seldom touch but is necessary for rdoc to build.\r\n\r\nNot being able to execute the task more than once seems to be a bug on one hand, but on the other hand the fact no one has ever fixed it since the change took place 7-8 years ago makes me biased to believe this is not a bug.\r\n\r\nI've followed [the rdoc section in the guides](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/api_documentation_guidelines.html#rdoc) and got stuck. That's why I believe something can be fixed, but I'm afraid I'm not able to tell if this is a program issue or a documentation issue.\r\n\r\nSo I'd like to seek advice.

This meant that PrismRenderParser was being tested on Ruby 3.3 and RipperRenderParser was tested on Ruby < 3.3. Additionally, if someone were to add prism to the rails/rails Gemfile because they wrote a tool that uses it then the RipperRenderParser would end up completely untested.\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nThis commit is a small refactor to enable testing both RenderParsers in all Ruby versions so that the prism gem can be added to the Gemfile.",

However, if migrations want to be manipulated/used by a non-rake program this initialization would miss any extra directories configured by the user.\r\n\r\nWe move the initialization to an initializer block. With this we can remove the rake config since it depends on `environment` anyway.\r\n\r\n### Motivation / Background\r\n\r\nIn our app we use schema-based multitenancy which means we need to setup and migrate for each tenant. We have created\r\na few helpers to aid in this task. \r\nRecently, we began modularizing our app, and started moving our migrations into packs. \r\nThen we started facing issues with migrations that tried to run more than once.\r\nWe diagnosed the root cause that our tenant creation command was not invoking `db:load_config` before loading the schema.\r\nThis resulted in \"packed\" migrations not being recorded in the initial seed of the `schema_migrations` table. Then when we attempted to run migrations on that tenant those migrations would try to run and fail. \r\n\r\nThis Pull Request has been created because a fix for this is to ensure whenever the app is loaded, the correct default paths\r\nare loaded.\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nThis Pull Request changes the initialization from a rake task to the app initialization process.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change. Changes that are unrelated should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message. Ex: `[Fix #issue-number]`\r\n* [ ] Tests are added or updated if you fix a bug or add a feature.\r\n* [ ] CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature. Minor bug fixes and documentation changes should not be included.\r\n",

The main fix is the removal of unnecessary `!_read_attribute(column)` check which was preventing the auto-generated PK value from being set on the record.\r\n\r\nThis change also revealed an issue with the `_returning_columns_for_insert` list built when using one of the MySQL adapters. The list had excessive number of column names even though MySQL is only capable of returning one column value, which is the last inserted ID. This commit overrides the `return_value_after_insert?` for mysql adapters to only return `true` for `auto_increment?` column unless database supports `RETURNING` statement.\r\n",

The first code snippet shows abstract namespaces like `errors.attributes.[attribute_name]` while the second one demonstrates the materialized one like `errors.attributes.name.blank`. The first code snippet lacks the validation error \"key.\" My team member was confused and created a translation without \"key\", so I think it would be helpful to add \".[key]\" to the abstract namespaces.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* ~[ ] This Pull Request is related to one change.

I want to validate the approach before proceeding.\r\n\r\nInside action mailer I am reusing private methods from the implementation of callbacks from the action controller, see https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/main/actionpack/lib/abstract_controller/callbacks.rb.\r\n\r\nThe questions to consider are:\r\n1. Should the mailer callbacks really depend on the internals of controller callbacks, considering that it already includes it https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/776626ff987a96201b0bdbd86d716ca6698fa8b3/actionmailer/lib/action_mailer/base.rb#L493\r\n2. Controllers callbacks have a `raise_on_missing_callbacks_action`, see https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/776626ff987a96201b0bdbd86d716ca6698fa8b3/actionpack/lib/abstract_controller/callbacks.rb#L36 which can be set via `config.action_controller. raise_on_missing_callbacks_action`. This kinda makes sense for action mailer too, so should we introduce `config.action_mailer.raise_on_missing_callbacks_action` config? \r\n3. Controller callbacks use the word `\"controller\"`, see https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/776626ff987a96201b0bdbd86d716ca6698fa8b3/actionpack/lib/abstract_controller/callbacks.rb#L54, while for mailer we should use the `\"mailer\"` word or should we make the message text more generic? \r\n\r\ncc @bensheldon ",

I believe I've found a use case where incorrect ActiveRecord objects are being returned when using `eager_load` or `includes` on a `has_one` association with composite primary keys. `preload` works as expected.\r\n\r\nRepro:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n# This code is under MIT license: See full license https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/main/MIT-LICENSE\r\n# frozen_string_literal: true\r\n\r\nrequire \"bundler/inline\"\r\n\r\ngemfile(true) do\r\n  source \"https://rubygems.org\"\r\n\r\n  gem \"activerecord\", \"7.1.3\"\r\n  gem \"sqlite3\"\r\nend\r\n\r\nrequire \"active_record\"\r\nrequire \"minitest/autorun\"\r\nrequire \"logger\"\r\n\r\n# This connection will do for database-independent bug reports.\r\nActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection(adapter: \"sqlite3\", database: \":memory:\")\r\n\r\nActiveRecord::Schema.define do\r\n  create_table :companies do |t|\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  create_table :users, primary_key: [:id, :company_id], force: true do |t|\r\n    t.integer :id\r\n    t.integer :company_id\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  create_table :profiles, primary_key: [:id, :company_id], force: true do |t|\r\n    t.integer :id\r\n    t.integer :company_id\r\n    t.integer :user_id\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n\r\nclass Company < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n  has_many :users\r\nend\r\n\r\nclass User < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n  belongs_to :company\r\n  has_one :profile, query_constraints: [:user_id, :company_id]\r\nend\r\n\r\nclass Profile < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n  belongs_to :user, query_constraints: [:user_id, :company_id]\r\nend\r\n\r\nclass BugTest < Minitest::Test\r\n  # FAIL\r\n  def test_eager_load\r\n    company = Company.create!\r\n    user1 = User.create!(id: [1, company.id])\r\n    Profile.create(id: [101, company.id], user: user1)\r\n    user2 = User.create!(id: [2, company.id])\r\n    Profile.create(id: [102, company.id], user: user2)\r\n\r\n    relation = company.users.joins(:profile)\r\n\r\n    assert_equal relation.map(&:profile), relation.eager_load(:profile).map(&:profile)\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  # FAIL\r\n  def test_includes\r\n    company = Company.create!\r\n    user1 = User.create!(id: [3, company.id])\r\n    Profile.create(id: [103, company.id], user: user1)\r\n    user2 = User.create!(id: [4, company.id])\r\n    Profile.create(id: [104, company.id], user: user2)\r\n\r\n    relation = company.users.joins(:profile)\r\n\r\n    assert_equal relation.map(&:profile), relation.includes(:profile).map(&:profile)\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  # PASS\r\n  def test_preload\r\n    company = Company.create!\r\n    user1 = User.create!(id: [5, company.id])\r\n    Profile.create(id: [105, company.id], user: user1)\r\n    user2 = User.create!(id: [6, company.id])\r\n    Profile.create(id: [106, company.id], user: user2)\r\n\r\n    relation = company.users.joins(:profile)\r\n\r\n    assert_equal relation.map(&:profile), relation.preload(:profile).map(&:profile)\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn that test, we are traversing the association from `company.users` and want to load each user's `profile` to avoid N+1 queries. However, the query is returning the first profile for **all** users.\r\n\r\nThe generated SQL queries look correct to me:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT\r\n    \"users\".\"id\" AS t0_r0,\r\n    \"users\".\"company_id\" AS t0_r1,\r\n    \"profiles\".\"id\" AS t1_r0,\r\n    \"profiles\".\"company_id\" AS t1_r1,\r\n    \"profiles\".\"user_id\" AS t1_r2\r\nFROM\r\n    \"users\"\r\n    INNER JOIN \"profiles\" ON \"profiles\".\"user_id\" = \"users\".\"id\"\r\n        AND \"profiles\".\"company_id\" = \"users\".\"company_id\"\r\nWHERE\r\n    \"users\".\"company_id\" = ?\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich leads me to believe that the issue is when converting to ActiveRecord objects.\r\n\r\nThe bug seems to only be present when the composite primary key is setup as `[:id, :foreign_key_id]`. When setup the other way around `[:foreign_key_id, :id]` (as is the case in the [Rails test schema](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/21eceb7db26b724d1f7a824d4cc04ddeba44244b/activerecord/test/schema/schema.rb#L244)) the bug is not present.\r\n\r\nThank you so much for your work!",

Currently, this behavior is implemented in the code but not mentioned in the official documentation. This can lead to confusion for developers who rely on the Rails guides for accurate information on how ActiveRecord associations work. Including this information will improve the clarity and comprehensiveness of the Rails documentation.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nThis Pull Request adds documentation comments to the belongs_to and has_one methods in ActiveRecord::Associations to explain that autosave: true also enables validations by default. This is to reflect the actual behavior of these methods, as described in the source code and observed in application behavior.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nReference to the issue discussed in Rails: Undocumented - validations enabled by autosave #50807\r\nInline gemfile with bundler example -\r\n``` ruby\r\nrequire \"bundler/inline\"\r\n\r\ngemfile do\r\n  source \"https://rubygems.org\"\r\n  gem \"rails\", \"7.1.3\"\r\n  gem \"sqlite3\"\r\nend\r\n\r\nrequire \"active_record\"\r\nrequire \"minitest/autorun\"\r\nrequire \"logger\"\r\n\r\n# This connection will do for database-independent bug reports.\r\nActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection(adapter: \"sqlite3\", database: \":memory:\")\r\nActiveRecord::Base.logger = Logger.new(STDOUT)\r\n\r\nActiveRecord::Schema.define do\r\n  create_table :authors do |t|\r\n    t.string :name\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  create_table :books do |t|\r\n    t.belongs_to :author\r\n    t.string :title\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n\r\nclass Author < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n  has_one :book, autosave: true\r\nend\r\n\r\nclass Book < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n  belongs_to :author\r\n  validates :title, presence: true\r\nend\r\n\r\nclass BugTest < Minitest::Test\r\n  def test_autosave_with_validations\r\n    author = Author.new(name: \"J.K.

However, the side_data is not guaranteed to be in the same position for all videos. For instance, HDR videos shot on iOS in portrait mode have \"DOVI configuration record\" side_data in the first position, followed by the \"Display matrix\" side data containing the rotation value.\r\n\r\nThis fix removes the positional reference and explicitely searches for the \"Display Matrix\" side_data to retrieve the rotation angle.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n<!-- Provide additional information such as benchmarks, reference to other repositories or alternative solutions. -->\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change. Changes that are unrelated should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message. Ex: `[Fix #issue-number]`\r\n* [x] Tests are added or updated if you fix a bug or add a feature.\r\n* [x] CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature. Minor bug fixes and documentation changes should not be included.\r\n",

        "body": "### Steps to reproduce\r\nApologies for not following the template. I wasn't sure how to include my half-baked fix with it... I have full repro and additional information here: [malavbhavsar/rails#1](https://github.com/malavbhavsar/rails/pull/1) \r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nuser_1 = User.create!(name: \"Jason\")\r\nuser_1.highlights.attach(\r\n  1000.times.map do |i|\r\n    {\r\n      io: StringIO.new(\"Example string inside text_file_#{i}\"),\r\n      filename: \"text_file_#{i}.txt\",\r\n      content_type: \"text/plain\",\r\n    }\r\n  end\r\n)\r\nuser_1.save!\r\nuser_1.reload\r\n\r\n# Below operation takes 5 seconds\r\nBenchmark.bm(30) do |x|\r\n  x.report(\"attach performance without fix\") do\r\n    user_1.highlights.attach(\r\n      {\r\n        io: StringIO.new(\"another text file. wow.\"),\r\n        filename: \"text_file_another.txt\",\r\n        content_type: \"text/plain\",\r\n      }\r\n    )\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nExecution time of `#attach` should not depend on how big a collection is.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\nOn a big `has_many_attached` collection, `#attach` takes a long time. If there are 1000 existing attachments, it will take 5 seconds to attach a new one.\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n**Rails version**: `main`\r\n\r\n**Ruby version**: `3.1.4`\r\n\r\n### Explanation\r\nWhen we call `#attach` on an already big activestorage collection, it first calls `record.public_send(\"#{name}=\", blobs + attachables.flatten) # e.g. record.highlights=...`. This eventually ends up calling `CollectionAssociation#replace_common_records_in_memory` which has been discovered as a performance problem in #46652. It ends up calling `Array#index` **n** times and `#==` **(n*n1)/2** times. In this case, `499500` times.\r\n\r\nFor ActiveRecord has_many collections, this is not a huge problem because, in my experience, `post.comments = new_comments` is not a common pattern. The general use case is `post.comments << new_comment`, which does pretty well performance-wise.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for `has_many_attached` collection, calling `#attach` is a common use case and it calls `record.things_attachments=` under the hood. Aside - seems like people are running into this [problem](https://discuss.rubyonrails.org/t/attach-pictures-gets-very-slow/81684).\r\n\r\n### Flamegraph\r\n![flamegraph_1](https://github.com/rails/rails/assets/1080592/0bef4acf-aaa7-44b8-a830-daf4a6717ab5)\r\n\r\n### Possible solutions\r\n- Get #46652 merged\r\n- If we are concerned about the increased complexity of `@target_index_map` in #46652, I tried the [same approach with a local variable](https://github.com/malavbhavsar/rails/pull/1/files#diff-ceff30ddab4e756e3a70ece45076eb17ff2f587a068dae657d2ad3a265a3f0d6) and it helped.\r\n\r\n### ANOTHER problem\r\nAs flamegraph shows, there is another O(N^2) in `#attach`. That one is coming from `Attached::Changes::CreateOneOfMany#find_attachment`. I haven't figured out a possible solution for it... I don't understand the change tracking(?) active storage is doing but if someone can help me understand I can try fixing it. I assume this will probably need a new `Attached::Changes::AttachMany` and `Attached::Changes::AttachOne`?\r\n\r\n### Workaround\r\nI have found that creating blobs and attachments manually gets rid of BOTH problems and doesn't leave `highlights_attachments` and `highlights_blobs` stale.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nuser_3 = User.create!(name: \"Lauren\")\r\nuser_3.highlights.attach(\r\n  1000.times.map do |i|\r\n    {\r\n      io: StringIO.new(\"Example string inside text_file_#{i}\"),\r\n      filename: \"text_file_#{i}.txt\",\r\n      content_type: \"text/plain\",\r\n    }\r\n  end\r\n)\r\nuser_3.save!\r\nuser_3.reload\r\n\r\n# Below operation takes 0.02 second\r\nApplicationRecord.transaction do\r\n  blob = ActiveStorage::Blob.create_and_upload!(\r\n    io: StringIO.new(\"another text file. wow.\"),\r\n    filename: \"text_file_another.txt\",\r\n    content_type: \"text/plain\",\r\n  )\r\n  user_3.highlights_attachments.create!(\r\n    blob_id: blob.id,\r\n    name: 'highlights',\r\n  )\r\n  user_3.save!\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Final performance stats\r\n\r\n```\r\n                                              user     system      total        real\r\nattach performance without fix            4.711782   0.013564   4.725346 (  4.760098)\r\n                                              user     system      total        real\r\nattach performance with half-ish fix      1.855833   0.009120   1.864953 (  1.901090)\r\n                                              user     system      total        real\r\nattach performance manual                 0.024790   0.002624   0.027414 (  0.030269)\r\n```\r\n\r\ncc: @jonathanhefner, @jeffcarbs, @danny-pflughoeft",

For example `posts` records with composite keys like `[\"post1\", \"the_same_author\"]` and `[\"post2\", \"the_same_author\"]` end up sharing the same cache entry under the `the_same_author` key.\r\n\r\nThis commit fixes the issue by using full composite primary key values as a whole identifier.",

        "body": "### Motivation / Background\r\n\r\nThis Pull Request fixes a bug in the low-level SQLite adapter introspection logic. I came across the bug when working with virtual columns and JSON, but there are many possible cases where this would cause problems. Here is one reproducible bug script though:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n# frozen_string_literal: true\r\n\r\nrequire \"bundler/inline\"\r\n\r\ngemfile(true) do\r\n  source \"https://rubygems.org\"\r\n\r\n  git_source(:github) { |repo| \"https://github.com/#{repo}.git\" }\r\n\r\n  gem \"rails\", github: \"rails/rails\", branch: \"main\"\r\n  gem \"sqlite3\"\r\nend\r\n\r\nrequire \"active_record\"\r\nrequire \"minitest/autorun\"\r\nrequire \"logger\"\r\n\r\nActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection(adapter: \"sqlite3\", database: \":memory:\");\r\nActiveRecord::Base.logger = Logger.new(STDOUT)\r\n\r\nActiveRecord::Schema.define do\r\n  create_table :posts, force: true do |t|\r\n    t.json :payload, null: false, default: {}\r\n    t.virtual :external_id, type: :string, as: \"JSON_EXTRACT(payload, '$.id')\", stored: true, null: false, index: true\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n\r\nclass Post < ActiveRecord::Base; end\r\n\r\nclass BugTest < Minitest::Test\r\n  def test_virtual_column_with_comma_in_definition_is_autopopulated\r\n    post = Post.create!(payload: { id: 'pst_1' })\r\n\r\n    assert_equal 'pst_1', post.external_id\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nThis Pull Request more intelligently parses the SQL string description of the table to ensure that we only split by commas that mark a new column definition. In order to accomplish this, the table parsing method needs the list of column names for the table. When `table_structure_sql` is called by `table_structure_with_collation`, these can be supplied as they are already present; when it is called by `foreign_keys`, however, they are not present and thus must be fetched.\r\n\r\nI also added a simple regression test as a part of the virtual column test case.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nThis bug has existed for a long time, but I most recently touched the relevant code in https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/49376.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change. Changes that are unrelated should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message. Ex: `[Fix #issue-number]`\r\n* [x] Tests are added or updated if you fix a bug or add a feature.\r\n* [x] CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature. Minor bug fixes and documentation changes should not be included.\r\n\r\ncc: @byroot (this is related to #49346), @tenderlove (this is related to https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/49290), @yahonda (this is related to https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/49376)\r\n",

Changes that are unrelated should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [ ] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message. Ex: `[Fix #issue-number]`\r\n* [ ] Tests are added or updated if you fix a bug or add a feature.\r\n* [ ] CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature. Minor bug fixes and documentation changes should not be included.\r\n",

Technically, only/except can be emulated via `if` option, but another problem is that's not clear from the documentation which options can be passed (currently `only` and `except` are simply ignored).\r\n\r\nI believe that many developers might except `ActionMailer` to behave just like `ActionController`,  so current API implementation might lead to unexpected bugs.\r\n\r\nNote that documentation on `before_action` (and similar callbacks) explicitly refer to possible options:\r\n\r\n> before_action(names, block)[Link](https://api.rubyonrails.org/v7.1.3/classes/AbstractController/Callbacks/ClassMethods.html#method-i-before_action)\r\n> Append a callback before actions. See [_insert_callbacks](https://api.rubyonrails.org/v7.1.3/classes/AbstractController/Callbacks/ClassMethods.html#method-i-_insert_callbacks) for parameter details.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nAt least some explicit info on possible `*_delivery` callback options, or (which would be better) support for `only` and `except` options.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\nMentioned options are simply ignored, no documentation on possible options.\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n**Rails version**: 7.1.3\r\n\r\n**Ruby version**: 3.0.6\r\n",

        "body": "### Detail\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes an issue where non-hash where-clause values for associations would not set `references_values`. This could (and often does) end up causing hard-to-debug SQL errors due to association name vs table name mismatch, e.g. querying on a singular association name while the actual join table is plural, or vice-versa due to a prior scope.\r\n\r\nMore detailed reproduction script:  https://gist.github.com/ezekg/5969735eb8c5092fb25198bd8fac4053\r\n\r\n#### Before\r\n\r\n```rb\r\nscope = Comment.where(post: { id: post })\r\nscope.references_values # => [\"post\"]\r\n\r\nscope = Comment.where(post: post)\r\nscope.references_values # => []\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'd expect these to be synonymous since [`#id` is called on `post`](https://github.com/ezekg/rails/blob/c37450b76b24cac7951032c4210db17a9c1b7f51/activerecord/lib/active_record/relation/predicate_builder.rb#L58) for the second case.\r\n\r\n#### After\r\n\r\n```rb\r\nscope = Comment.where(post: { id: post })\r\nscope.references_values # => [\"post\"]\r\n\r\nscope = Comment.where(post: post)\r\nscope.references_values # => [\"post\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith this patch, they're now more or less synonymous, both setting `references_values`.\r\n\r\nSince this is likely a breaking change (it broke a few tests in [keygen-sh/keygen-api](https://github.com/keygen-sh/keygen-api) when testing against the patch), this may require some more thought. But it is worth noting that all broken tests were related to various workarounds for this particular bug.\r\n\r\nLet me know what you guys think is the best course of action here.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change. Changes that are unrelated should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why.

Minor bug fixes and documentation changes should not be included.\r\n",

Changes that are unrelated should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message. Ex: `[Fix #issue-number]`\r\n* ~[ ] Tests are added or updated if you fix a bug or add a feature.~ not applicable\r\n* [x] CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature. Minor bug fixes and documentation changes should not be included.\r\n",

        "body": "### Motivation / Background\r\n\r\nI've had to check in a few places if a relation had exactly or less than or more than N records. On top of that, if the collection contains a lot of records, counting on the entire collection not only is slower but also unnecessary and limiting the count the first N or N+1 records is sufficient and faster.\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nAdds the following methods to `ActiveRecord::Relation::FinderMethods`:\r\n  * `exactly?` returns true if the relation contains exactly N records, false otherwise.\r\n  * `at_least?` returns true if the relation contains at least N records, false otherwise.\r\n  * `at_most?` returns true if the relation contains at most N records, false otherwise.\r\n  * `less_than?` returns true if the relation contains less than N records, false otherwise.\r\n  * `more_than?` returns true if the relation contains more than N records, false otherwise.\r\n\r\nThese methods perform a `limit(M).count` (where M = N or N + 1) under the hood.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nI think the naming of these methods is fine as is. Don't know if others would prefer to prefix these with `has_` or `contains_`, ie `has_exactly?` or `contains_exactly?`.\r\n\r\nWith regards to performance of doing the count with and without the limit. Without the limit when there are 8M records I get:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\n  Referral Count (135.2ms)  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM \"referrals\" WHERE \"referrals\".\"company_id\" = $1  [[\"company_id\", \"29f1dfa2-01d0-4e5d-b482-7aa1f3ba7535\"]]\r\n=> 8467786\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith a limit of a 100:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\n  Referral Count (0.4ms)  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (SELECT 1 AS one FROM \"referrals\" WHERE \"referrals\".\"company_id\" = $1 LIMIT $2) subquery_for_count  [[\"company_id\",\"29f1dfa2-01d0-4e5d-b482-7aa1f3ba7535\", [\"LIMIT\", 100]]\r\n=> 100\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo it's 300x faster even when doing an index only scan:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nexplain SELECT COUNT(*) FROM \"referrals\" WHERE \"referrals\".\"company_id\" ='29f1dfa2-01d0-4e5d-b482-7aa1f3ba7535';\r\n\r\n                                                                          QUERY PLAN                                                                           \r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n Finalize Aggregate  (cost=136744.58..136744.59 rows=1 width=8)\r\n   ->  Gather  (cost=136744.36..136744.57 rows=2 width=8)\r\n         Workers Planned: 2\r\n         ->  Partial Aggregate  (cost=135744.36..135744.37 rows=1 width=8)\r\n               ->  Parallel Index Only Scan using index_referrals_on_company_id_and_conversion_state on referrals  (cost=0.56..127008.31 rows=3494420 width=0)\r\n                     Index Cond: (company_id = '29f1dfa2-01d0-4e5d-b482-7aa1f3ba7535'::uuid)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change.

This change adds format constraints to the generated routes.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nI didn't see associated tests with the previous change but would be open to adding some if desired.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [ ] This Pull Request is related to one change.

        "body": "### Motivation / Background\r\n\r\nThis Pull Request has been created because there are a few PRs we'd like to open that relate to the multiple database code in Rails but there was no existing template for a multiple database setup. 🙂 \r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nThis commit adds a new bug report template that's based off of the existing [Active Record bug report\r\ntemplate](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/main/guides/bug_report_templates/active_record.rb) but creates a multiple database setup.\r\n\r\nThe template creates an `UnshardedModel` abstract `ActiveRecord` model that connects to a single database (with a replica configured) and a `ShardedModel` abstract `ActiveRecord` model that has two shards configured, each with their own replica.\r\n\r\nEach sqlite3 in-memory database is separate because [opening multiple database connections each with the filename \":memory:\" will create independent in-memory databases](https://www.sqlite.org/inmemorydb.html).\r\n\r\nNote, that while replica databases are configured, sqlite3 does not support database replication and therefore records written to the writer databases will not auto-populate on the replica/reader databases. The replica configurations are included to allow for testing role switching, not for validating replication itself.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nYou can test that the template works by running:\r\n\r\n `ruby guides/bug_report_templates/active_record_multiple_databases.rb` \r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change. Changes that are unrelated should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message. Ex: `[Fix #issue-number]`\r\n* [ ] Tests are added or updated if you fix a bug or add a feature.\r\n* [ ] CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature. Minor bug fixes and documentation changes should not be included.\r\n",

        "body": "### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nThere are the following two classes, each of which causes deadlock between Threads when loaded from different Threads.\r\nThis occurs in the development environment. That is, `enable_reloading? == true` `allow_concurrency == nil`. \r\n\r\nSample Application: https://github.com/alpaca-tc/zeitwerk-test\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n# app/models/first.rb\r\nmodule First\r\n  Second\r\nend\r\n\r\n# app/models/second.rb\r\nmodule Second\r\n  First\r\nend\r\n\r\n# app/controllers/constants_controller.rb\r\nclass ConstantsController < ActionController::Base\r\n  def first\r\n    First\r\n    head :no_content\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  def second\r\n    Second\r\n    head :no_content\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n\r\n# config/routes.rb\r\nRails.application.routes.draw do\r\n  get '/first', to: 'constants#first'\r\n  get '/second', to: 'constants#second'\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Deadlock when requesting in parallel. \r\n$ curl http://127.0.0.1:3000/first\r\n$ curl http://127.0.0.1:3000/second\r\n```\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/alpaca-tc/zeitwerk-test\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nEach request can be executed without deadlock.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe thread deadlocks and the request is stopped as Processing.\r\n\r\n```\r\nbundle exec rails server\r\n...\r\nStarted GET \"/first\" for 127.0.0.1 at 2024-01-19 16:31:35 +0900\r\nStarted GET \"/second\" for 127.0.0.1 at 2024-01-19 16:31:35 +0900\r\nProcessing by ConstantsController#first as */*\r\nProcessing by ConstantsController#second as */*\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nIf I reproduce it minimum, this issue is similar to the following gist.\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/alpaca-tc/eb9ac65b7761276766c63948c7099cff\r\n\r\nWhen a file with cyclic dependencies is `require/autoload`-ed by multi-thread, a deadlock occurs.\r\nThis behavior is intentional for Ruby.\r\n\r\nPerhaps to prevent this, an exclusive lock should be acquired by `ActiveSupport::Dependencies.load_interlock` during `require` by zeitwerk. However, since there is no API in zeitwerk to such a hook, I did not know where I should acquire the lock.\r\nThe classic autoloader took an exclusive lock, so this problem does not occur.\r\nhttps://github.com/rails/rails//blob/ac6aa32f7cf66264ba87eabed7c042bb60bcf3a2/activesupport/lib/active_support/dependencies.rb#L358-L392\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nRails Version: main\r\nRuby Version: ruby 3.2.2 (2023-03-30 revision e51014f9c0) [arm64-darwin22]\r\n\r\nI guess that it probably occurs in all versions that use zeitwerk.\r\nThis did not occur with the 6.1 classic autoloader.\n\n---\n\nSame issue https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/37320",

        "body": "### Motivation / Background\r\n\r\nThis is a fix needed to unblock https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/50284, because Active Storage relies on a Active Record bug.\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nThe problem is best understood with a small snippet:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nblob = ActiveStorage::Blob.new\r\n\r\nActiveStorage::Attachment.new(blob: blob)\r\nActiveStorage::Attachment.new(blob: blob)\r\n\r\n# Currently:\r\np blob.attachments #=> #<ActiveRecord::Associations::CollectionProxy []>\r\n\r\n# Once the Active Record bug is fixed:\r\np blob.attachments #=> #<ActiveRecord::Associations::CollectionProxy [#<ActiveStorage::Attachment id: nil, name: nil, record_type: nil, record_id: nil, blob_id: nil, created_at: nil>, #<ActiveStorage::Attachment id: nil, name: nil, record_type: nil, record_id: nil, blob_id: nil, created_at: nil>]>\r\n\r\n# Saving the blob would result in trying to create 2 attachments which\r\n# fails because of unique constraints.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nThe real code path that does what the snippet above does is located here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rails/rails/blob/9c3ffab47c3bf59320ba08e9dafdb0275cf91a5a/activestorage/lib/active_storage/attached/many.rb#L52\r\n\r\nIt's basically doing this:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nuser.images.attach \"photo1.png\"\r\n# Initialize a Blob record and an Attachment\r\n\r\nuser.images.attach \"photo2.png\"\r\n# Get the Blob from above, create another Attachment\r\n# Initialize a new Blob record and an new Attachment\r\n\r\n# Rinse and repeat every time `attach` is called\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\n- Explicitly set the `inverse_of`, so that it behaves as if #50284 is shipped\r\n- Don't build a new attachment for blob already having one.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\nI didn't add tests, the test suite is already well covered, adding the `inverse_of`\r\nwithout any changes breaks the test suite already. You can try by running\r\nfor instance the `activestorage/test/models/attached/many_test.rb`.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change. Changes that are unrelated should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message. Ex: `[Fix #issue-number]`\r\n* [ ] Tests are added or updated if you fix a bug or add a feature.\r\n* [ ] CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature. Minor bug fixes and documentation changes should not be included.\r\n",

So if someone has ideas on how to setup an sqlite trigger to generate `id` column value before insert - the test case can be tested against sqlite.

        "body": "### Context\r\n\r\nIn part for performance and simplicity reasons, and in part because of its historical lack of threading support, Active Record rely quite heavily on `ActiveRecord::Base.connection` checking out and holding a connection inside a thread of fiber local variable.\r\n\r\nConcretly, every request or job lazily checkout connections when it needs to perform a database operations, and then holds onto it until the request or job completes, at which point the `Executor` hook automatically check it back in the pool.\r\n\r\nFor the overwhelming majority of Rails application, which don't do enough IOs to benefit from more than a handful of threads, it's a perfectly adequate solution, as it pretty much remove connection management as a concern.\r\n\r\nHowever for applications that spent most of their time on IOs others than the database (e.g. 3rd party APIs), and would benefit from much higher levels of concurrency, this strategy is problematic because it requires about as many database connections as there is threads or fibers, even though most connections are idle but can't be used because they checked out of the pool and held by another thead or fiber.\r\n\r\n### Goal\r\n\r\nI believe the current model is still preferable for the vast majority of Rails users, and changing the way `ActiveRecord::Base.connection` behaves would break a ton of code anyway. So I believe it should remain the default.\r\n\r\nHowever I think we could support an alternative mode, in which `ActiveRecord::Base.connection` doesn't hold onto the connection until the end of the request cycle, but instead immediately check it back in, allowing it to be re-used immediately.\r\n\r\n### Implementation\r\n\r\nFirst, nothing changes unless you disable `ActiveRecord.cache_connection_checkout`.\r\n\r\nThen, since a lot of code in Rails itself, in third party libraries, and in private Rails applications do rely on `Model.connection.something()`, we must make it work without caching the connection.\r\n\r\nTo solve this, when caching is disabled, `Model.connection` returns a proxy object, that delegates the methods it receive to a freshly checked out connection, and then check it back in. See `LazyConnectionProxy` in `connection_pool.rb` for the details.\r\n\r\nThat is the key to permitting this feature while retaining backward compatibility. It's not perfect, as code might assume that subsequent calls to `Model.connection` will return the same connection instance, but in most case it's not necessary.\r\n\r\nAlso, while the proxy holds the connection, it caches in on the thread or fiber, so subsequent calls to `Model.connection` will return the same connection until it's checked back in. This solves most of the statefulness issues, like opening a transaction etc, as long as the APIs are blocked based.\r\n\r\n### Status\r\n\r\nThis is a proof of concept, it's nowhere near ready to merge, it's mostly to explore whether it's doable with some work, or just not possible.\r\n\r\nMost of the Active Record test suite passes against Sqlite3, except for 3 tests that do disconnect and reconnect. In general all the tests had to be opted out of the feature, I still need to dig into why exactly.\r\n\r\nI also had to disable the feature for a few test suites that rely too much on the caching, and would need a bit of refactoring to pass without, but at first glance it doesn't look like a fundamental incompatibility.\r\n\r\n### Concerns\r\n\r\nThere is a number of Active Record methods that currently cause more than one checkout/checkin cycle and would benefit from a strategically placed `with_connection do` call to optimize that. But that is mostly a performance concern, not a fundamental incompatibility.\r\n\r\nOne more major concern is the query cache. As it stand it's pretty much useless when checkout caching is disabled, because when we check the connection back in, we have to clear the cache, so it's pretty much always empty. To make it usable again, we need a substantial refactoring. At first glance it looks possible, just not trivial.\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\n\r\nI'm a bit on the fence about this. I think we can make it work, but I already spent most of one day on just the proof of concept, and would need substantially more work to iron out all the issues.\r\n\r\nThe actual code changes needed in Active Record itself are relatively small, it's really all the test suite and 3rd party code that would need to be updated to properly work with this option that is the big can of worm I'm worried about.\r\n",

Why is it important?\r\nIf you are fixing a specific issue, include \"Fixes #ISSUE\" (replace with the issue number, remove the quotes) and the issue will be linked to this PR.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIncluding a reference to the Solid Queue project in the Rails Guides documentation can be useful, especially but not exclusively for new developers, as it allows them to become familiar with the project and its functionalities, and decide whether they want to use it in their projects, just like the other suggested adapters.\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nThis pull request simply adds the reference (link to the project's README) in the Rails Guides documentation in the section dedicated to configuring adapters.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n Provide additional information such as benchmarks, reference to other repositories or alternative solutions. -->\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change. Changes that are unrelated should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message. Ex: `[Fix #issue-number]`\r\n* [x] Tests are added or updated if you fix a bug or add a feature.\r\n* [x] CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature. Minor bug fixes and documentation changes should not be included.\r\n",

Rails doesn't request PK after inserting a row in a view\r\n2. Rails doesn't request PK if PK populated by something Rails can't know about (examples: Vitess or a trigger)",

Helpful when #50444 lands.\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nThis Pull Request sets `options[:asset_pipeline]` in `AppUpdater` based on whether Sprockets/Propshaft Railtie is defined.\r\n\r\nWithout this change, `app:update` will suggest injecting sprocket configuration in a propshaft project.",

It's not super common and only happens on application load:\r\n\r\n```\r\nFrozenError: can't modify frozen Hash: {}\r\n[GEM_ROOT]/gems/actionview-7.1.2/lib/action_view/unbound_template.rb:31 :in `block in bind_locals`\r\n[GEM_ROOT]/gems/actionview-7.1.2/lib/action_view/unbound_template.rb:22 :in `synchronize`\r\n[GEM_ROOT]/gems/actionview-7.1.2/lib/action_view/unbound_template.rb:22 :in `bind_locals`\r\n[GEM_ROOT]/gems/actionview-7.1.2/lib/action_view/template/resolver.rb:145 :in `block in _find_all`\r\n[GEM_ROOT]/gems/actionview-7.1.2/lib/action_view/template/resolver.rb:144 :in `map`\r\n[GEM_ROOT]/gems/actionview-7.1.2/lib/action_view/template/resolver.rb:144 :in `_find_all` \r\n```\r\n\r\nLooking at [the source code](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/473fd597f6ff8a575c36c565d205627fa7964a05/actionview/lib/action_view/unbound_template.rb#L21-L38), I think I might know what is happening. When the server boots up, 2 threads hit the same `UnboundTemplate` instance before it has set up `@templates`. Both threads get past the `unless template = @templates[locals]` check because `@templates[locals]` isn't set yet. However, with `@write_lock`, one thread waits while the other one proceeds, setting `@templates` to a frozen hash. The second thread then gets the write lock and tries to modify `@templates` but it has been frozen.\r\n\r\nIt looks to me like it might make sense to move the `@templates[locals.dup] = template` bit into an `else` case below to prevent subsequent threads from trying to modify the hash.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nIt's a bit tricky to reproduce, but I think you could do it if you put a binding just after the `unless template = @templates[locals]` and had two processes try to access a template for the first time. When both are there, you could exit the bindings and one process should cause an error.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nIt should not raise an error when templates are loaded and strict locals are in use.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nWe get errors on many of our deploys as the server boots up.\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n**Rails version**: 7.1.2\r\n\r\n**Ruby version**: 3.2.2\r\n",

However, the `t.references` method was missing in the compatibility layer which results in pre 7.1 Migrations validating options passed to `t.references`.\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nThis commit fixes the issue by adding t.references to the compatibility layer.\r\n\r\nSee also a [similar fix][2] for `add_reference`\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/e6da3ebd6c65af23d134a9e01145f26600912008\r\n[2]: https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/71b4e223018d180b7c96915c0df1c28afbf7cc53\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change. Changes that are unrelated should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message. Ex: `[Fix #issue-number]`\r\n* [x] Tests are added or updated if you fix a bug or add a feature.\r\n* [x] CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature. Minor bug fixes and documentation changes should not be included.\r\n",

Loading the associations in a join can result in many rows that contain redundant data and it performs poorly at scale.\r\n\r\nWith `includes` a separate query is performed for each association, unless a join is required by conditions.\r\n\r\n`includes` is also used by similar methods in Active Storage like `with_attached_*`.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change. Changes that are unrelated should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message. Ex: `[Fix #issue-number]`\r\n* [x] Tests are added or updated if you fix a bug or add a feature.\r\n* [x] CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature. Minor bug fixes and documentation changes should not be included.\r\n",

It seems to me that the issue is that [this expression](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/0656787be644d7d5550e82450153403853c73014/activerecord/lib/active_record/associations/builder/belongs_to.rb#L39C5-L39C5) can return `nil`. I'm just not sure how it should be solved (by raising, autoloading, warning, ...)\r\n",

Changes that are unrelated should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message. Ex: `[Fix #issue-number]`\r\n* [x] Tests are added or updated if you fix a bug or add a feature.\r\n* [x] CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature. Minor bug fixes and documentation changes should not be included.",

This has been working fine in most cases, but it seems that sometimes Google doesn't include body text in the email—only a zipped XML file as an attachment.\r\n\r\nWhen this happens, Action Mailbox decodes the Base64 encoding of the attachment and assigns the string representation of the binary data to the body of the message without adding the file as an attachment. I have noticed that the email also isn't recognised as being multipart.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nI've created [a gist which includes the unedited email source](https://gist.github.com/HashNotAdam/f5d08e370e70e9e39105fa765563c5b3) as copied from the EML file stored by Active Storage\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nThe body of the message should include the Base64 encoding of the attachment and there should be 1 attachment representing a ZIP file\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\nCalling `body.to_s` on the underlying `Mail::Message` will return a string representation of the binary data which can be unzipped to return the XML. If the EML file were to be opened in an email client, this would be presented as an attachment\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n**Rails version**: 7.1.2\r\n\r\n**Ruby version**: 3.2.2",

For regular `LogSubscriber`s, `subscribe_log_level` could be used to optimize these cases but the Start subscriber is not a subclass of `LogSubscriber`.\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nThis commit implements a `#subscribed?` method for the Start subscriber so that it can also benefit from the `subscribe_log_level` optimization.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change. Changes that are unrelated should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message. Ex: `[Fix #issue-number]`\r\n* [x] Tests are added or updated if you fix a bug or add a feature.\r\n* [x] CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature. Minor bug fixes and documentation changes should not be included.\r\n",

What bug have you fixed? What feature have you added? Why is it important?\r\nIf you are fixing a specific issue, include \"Fixes #ISSUE\" (replace with the issue number, remove the quotes) and the issue will be linked to this PR.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis Pull Request has been created because comments in `ActionView::Helpers::FormHelper` refer to the deprecated `form_for` instead of the recommended `form_with`. This could potentially cause confusion for developers consulting the Rails API documentation, such as [Action View Form Builder page](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/FormBuilder.html).\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nThis Pull Request changes  the comments in `ActionView::Helpers::FormHelper`, replacing instances of `form_for` with `form_with`.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nThe Rails guide has already documented the usage of `form_with` on the [form_helpers page](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/form_helpers.html).\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change. Changes that are unrelated should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message. Ex: `[Fix #issue-number]`\r\n* [x] Tests are added or updated if you fix a bug or add a feature.\r\n* [x] CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature. Minor bug fixes and documentation changes should not be included.\r\n",

We are unsure if a PR against the `6-1-stable` branch is the way to properly update the Rails 6.1 Edge Guides, so please advise if not.  Also, please let us know if the Rails 6.0 and Rails 5.2 Guides should also have this back ported.\r\n\r\n<!-- Provide additional information such as benchmarks, reference to other repositories or alternative solutions. -->\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change.

If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message. Ex: `[Fix #issue-number]`\r\n* [ ] Tests are added or updated if you fix a bug or add a feature.\r\n* [ ] CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature.

If single quotes are used in the definition of a default generated column, the schema dump will escape the quotes twice.\r\n\r\nIn a scenario such as the following:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\ncreate_table :people, force: true do |t|\r\n  t.string :first_name\r\n  t.string :last_name\r\n  t.string :full_name, default: -> { \"(concat(`first_name`,_utf8mb4'-',`last_name`))\" }\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe want the schema dump to look like this:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nt.string \"full_name\", default: -> { \"(concat(`first_name`,_utf8mb4'-',`last_name`))\" }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd not this, which is how it now it is now:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nt.string \"full_name\", default: -> { \"(concat(`first_name`,_utf8mb4\\\\'-\\\\',`last_name`))\" }\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee the related issue for more.\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nThis pull request changes the schema statement generator under the `elsif` block for a column with `DEFAULT_GENERATED` in the metadata. In the changes, we simply `gsub` the escapes as we do in other parts of the class.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change. Changes that are unrelated should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message.\r\n* [x] Tests are added or updated if you fix a bug or add a feature.\r\n* [x] CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature. Minor bug fixes and documentation changes should not be included.\r\n",

Writing to the Rails cache shouldn't invalidate the main query cache.\r\n\r\nThis is an alternative to https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/50695, based on @byroot's [suggestion here](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/50695#issuecomment-1885312807).\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nAfter a database write we clear the query cache on all connection pools. The change here is that we will now only do that if either the connection pool or the connection itself has the query cache enabled.\r\n\r\nThe query cache is [enabled on all connection pools](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/cff2eb1be11cb729382b3674e3caa2bd198ec55e/activerecord/lib/active_record/query_cache.rb#L28-L42) by the executor hooks, so to take advantage of this we'll need to add another executor hook that disables the query cache on the Solid Cache connection pool (but only when it has a dedicated pool). \r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change.

To my suprise, when I tried to save \"updated\" occurence, rails tried to save ruby object's id \"#<Employee:0x0000026f69911560\" as a string, not its actual id as it was in start_employee. Despite of writing Employee object itself under @occurence[:start_employee], it's been saved as employee's id. The same happens when I fetch this, start_employee is being returned as eagerly loaded object, not only employee's id, finish_employee is loade with loaded only with pure id. Hope you get my problem.\r\n\r\nHere is example of one fetched occurence, after the initial creation and update with finish values:\r\nIn this example I was forced to pass only the id of fetched Employee to the finish_employee attribute, cause it otherwise tried to save ruby object's id, problem is I don't have any employee with such an ID.\r\n\r\n{\r\n    \"data\": {\r\n        \"id\": 1,\r\n        \"state\": 4,\r\n        \"injector\": {\r\n            \"id\": \"ST 52\",\r\n            \"location\": {\r\n                \"id\": \"Location name\"\r\n            },\r\n            \"duration\": 120,\r\n            \"ip\": \"0.0.0.0\"\r\n        },\r\n        \"description\": \"\",\r\n        \"start_employee\": {\r\n            \"id\": \"3779332794\",\r\n            \"name\": \"Surname Name\"\r\n        },\r\n        \"finish_employee\": \"3779332794\",\r\n        \"start\": \"2024-01-11T20:43:53.000Z\",\r\n        \"finish\": \"2024-01-11T20:44:14.000Z\"\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n**Rails version**: 7.0.8\r\n\r\n**Ruby version**: 3.2.2\r\n",

        "body": "### Description\r\n\r\n`ActiveJob::TestHelper` triggers the immediate loading of `ActiveJob::Base` because of the following line in its implementation:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rails/rails/blob/4230d0d2be9e4c85f6a32debe72cf98d8d464416/activejob/lib/active_job/test_helper.rb#L37\r\n\r\nThis is unexpected as other parts of `ActiveJob` take great care of deferring the loading of `ActiveJob::Base` thanks to the following construct:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nActiveSupport.on_load(:active_job) do\r\n  # Do something with ActiveJob::Base\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this can lead to situations in which `ActiveJob` configurations are not applied, because defined after the loading of `ActiveJob::Base`.\r\n\r\nExample of such a situation:\r\n\r\n1. Have a gem  in the `Gemfile` that (most likely inadvertently) triggers the loading of `ActiveJob::TestHelper`;\r\n2. Have `ActiveJob` configurations a in `config/initializers/active_job.rb` file (loaded after the gems from the application).\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nIn a terminal, set up this demo application:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nrails new active-job-issue-50713 && cd active-job-issue-50713\r\n\r\ncat <<RUBY >> Gemfile\r\n\r\ngem 'api-auth', '1.5.0'\r\n\r\ngroup :test do\r\n  gem 'minitest-spec-rails', '7.2.0'\r\nend\r\nRUBY\r\n\r\nbundle install\r\n\r\ncat <<RUBY > config/initializers/active_job.rb\r\nRails.application.config.active_job.default_queue_name = \"custom_default_queue\"\r\nRUBY\r\n\r\nmkdir -p test/jobs\r\n\r\ncat <<RUBY > test/jobs/application_job_test.rb\r\nrequire 'test_helper'\r\n\r\nclass ApplicationJobTest < ActiveSupport::TestCase\r\n  test \"default queue configured\" do\r\n    assert_equal \"custom_default_queue\", ApplicationJob.default_queue_name\r\n  end\r\nend\r\nRUBY\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, run this test:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nbin/rails test test/jobs/application_job_test.rb\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe test should pass, i.e. `ActiveJob::TestHelper` should not trigger the immediate loading of `ActiveJob::Base`, and let the the process load it (lazily or eagerly) when actually needed.\r\n\r\n#### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe test does not pass, since `ActiveJob::TestHelper` triggers the immediate loading of `ActiveJob::Base`.\r\n\r\n#### System configuration\r\n\r\n**Rails version**: 7.1.2 / main\r\n\r\n**Ruby version**: 3.2.2\r\n\r\n#### Detailed explanations about the test failure\r\n\r\nA legacy version of the `api-auth` gem is referenced in the `Gemfile`, which triggers the loading of `ActionController::Base` here: https://github.com/mgomes/api_auth/blob/v1.5.0/lib/api_auth/railtie.rb#L33-L35 (note that latest versions of the gem fixed that undesired behavior).\r\n\r\nIn turn, loading `ActionController::Base` triggers the loading of `ActionDispatch::IntegrationTest` in  `minitest-spec-rails`, another gem used in tests, see:\r\n* https://github.com/metaskills/minitest-spec-rails/blob/v7.2.0/lib/minitest-spec-rails/railtie.rb#L15\r\n* https://github.com/metaskills/minitest-spec-rails/blob/v7.2.0/lib/minitest-spec-rails/init/action_dispatch.rb#L14\r\n\r\nIn turn, loading `ActionDispatch::IntegrationTest` triggers the loading of `ActionMailer::TestHelper` here: https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/v7.1.2/actionmailer/lib/action_mailer/railtie.rb#L66.\r\n\r\nIn turn, loading `ActionMailer::TestHelper` triggers the loading of `ActiveJob::TestHelper` here: https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/v7.1.2/actionmailer/lib/action_mailer/test_helper.rb#L10.\r\n\r\nFinally, `ActiveJob::TestHelper` triggers the eager loading of `ActiveJob::Base` here: https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/v7.1.2/activejob/lib/active_job/test_helper.rb#L37\r\n\r\nThis code could/should be wrapped in a loading hook instead:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n- ActiveJob::Base.include(TestQueueAdapter)\r\n+ ActiveSupport.on_load(:active_job) do\r\n+   ActiveJob::Base.include(TestQueueAdapter)\r\n+ end\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, since `ActiveJob::Base` is eager loaded during the loading of the gems, it is before our initializers get a chance to run and modify the configs, which triggers the issue.\r\n",

        "body": "Ruby 3.3.0 supports Prism out of the box, so Rails applications with dependencies that require Prism don't need to explicitly define the `prism` gem in their Gemfile/gemspec anymore.

        "body": "### Problem\r\nIn our current Rails codebase, we frequently encounter situations where we need to check the presence, absence, or other conditions of multiple variables, which often results in long and repetitive code like this:\r\n```\r\nif a.present? && b.present? && c.present? && d.present? && e.present?\r\n  # Do something\r\nend\r\n```\r\nReading and maintaining such code can become cumbersome and error-prone, especially as the number of variables increases.\r\n### Proposal\r\nTo address this issue and enhance the readability and maintainability of our code, I think we can introduce consolidated methods for common check operations. These methods will simplify conditional checks on multiple variables and promote more elegant and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) coding practices.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nNew Methods\r\n`all_present?` `any_present?`\r\n`all_nil?` `any_nil?`\r\n `all_balnk?` `any_blank?`\r\n `all_true?` `any_true?`\r\n `all_false?` `any_false?`\r\n\r\nWe can introduce these new methods, which will accept multiple variables as arguments and return true if all or any of the variables are present, respectively. This would allow us to rewrite the previous example as follows:\r\n```\r\nif all_present?(a, b, c, d, e)\r\n  Do something\r\nend\r\n\r\nif any_present?(a, b, c, d, e)\r\n  Do something\r\nend\r\n\r\nif all_nil?(a, b, c, d, e)\r\n  Do something\r\nend\r\n\r\nif any_nil?(a, b, c, d, e)\r\n  Do something\r\nend\r\n\r\n-- all_true?, all_blank? etc.\r\n```\r\n### Generalized Methods:\r\n\r\nAlternatively, we can create more generalized methods that accept both the operation (e.g., :present, :nil, :blank, :true, :false) and the variables to check. For instance, a method signature might look like  `check_all(operation, *variables)`\r\n```\r\nif check_all(:present, a, b, c, d, e)\r\n  Do something\r\nend\r\n\r\nif check_all(:nil, a, b, c, d, e)\r\n  Do something\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis approach would provide flexibility for various types of checks beyond just presence.\r\n\r\n",
